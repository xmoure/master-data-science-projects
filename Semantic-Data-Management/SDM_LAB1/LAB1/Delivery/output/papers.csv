9e27a083-e5cc-4796-a969-013f68aaf697,Self-assessment of Proficiency of Intelligent Systems: Challenges and Opportunities,2021,"Autonomous systems, although capable of performing complicated tasks much faster than humans, are brittle due to uncertainties encountered in most real-time applications. People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holder’s goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase “proficient ‹preposition›” using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-51758-8_15

A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques. Teaching/learning experiments are proposed involving proportional, integral and derivative controllers with Feedforward and Cascade control structures. Preliminary results achieved in a Portuguese university are presented. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",10.1007/978-3-030-58653-9_3
ac5c33a3-39c6-4814-b313-2a392b20fc29,Structural design space exploration using principal component analysis,2020,"Design space exploration (DSE) is the process whereby a designer seeks to understand some results across a set of design variations. Structural DSE of turbomachinery compressor blades is often challenging because the large number of design variables make it difficult to learn the effect that each variable has upon the stress contours. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the stress contours is used as a way to understand how the stress contours change over the design space. Two methods are introduced to address the challenge of understanding how the stress changes over a large number of variables. First, a two-point correlation is applied to relate the design variables to the scores of each principal component. Second, a coupling of the stress and coordinate location of each node in PCA is developed which also indicates how the stress variations relate to geometric variations. These provide insight to how design variables influence the stress. It is shown how these methods use PCA as DSE tools to better explore the structural design space of compressor blades. Better DSE can improve compressor blades and the computational cost needed for their design. Copyright © 2020 by ASME",10.1115/1.4047428

While there is significant research regarding user motivation on dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder, and Match.com, there is no published research that discusses the motivations of Mutual app users. Developed as a dating app to target members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mutual allows users to find potential mates who share their religious background and specify their relationship readiness (from “Into Dating I Guess” to “Ready for a Ring”). This research aims to illuminate the various motivations, attitudes, and opinions of Mutual app users through Q methodology, which identifies perceptual groups among homogeneous populations through a factor analysis of participants’ agreement with similar statements regarding Mutual use. Findings indicated four factor groups: the Relationship Readies (i.e., those serious about dating), the Swipeaholics (i.e., those looking for entertainment), the Faithless (i.e., those who felt pressured to use Mutual), and the Eligible Optimists (i.e., those who saw the app as a convenient, entertaining way to date). Different from other research on dating apps, this study indicates that people may use a niche religion-focused dating app to find individuals with similar moral values or due to external pressure from others. Results warrant further investigation into niche dating apps. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.tele.2020.101448

We develop and study an integrated analytical and computational data-driven gray box environment needed to achieve this aim. Main ingredients include computational differential geometry-based model reduction, optimization-based compressed sensing, and a finite approximation of the Koopman operator. The proposed two-step procedure (the model reduction by differential geometric (information geometry) tools, and data refinement by the compressed sensing and Koopman theory based dynamics prediction) is illustrated on the multi-machine benchmark example of IEEE 14-bus system with renewable sources, where the results are shown for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) with local measurements in the connection point.

In this work, FBGs were integrated into a single-layer, Kevlar® fabric, sensing mat, placed between a 30-layer Kevlar® fabric shoot pack and clay backing material, and then impacted with an 8.23 g, 12.69 mm diameter, steel ball bearing at velocities up to 285 m/s. Three different optical fiber types, with differing fiber coatings and fiber diameters, were tested. The FBG strain response was determined from the full-spectrum FBG response which was interrogated at 100 kHz throughout the impact event. The difference in FBG strain response for the different coatings and fiber diameters were compared. Additionally, the degradation of the coatings after repeated impacts were visually characterized, showing that smaller diameter fibers behaved better with a more elastic coating. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.yofte.2020.102356
7283e8e2-efac-442d-a544-056cd43c0fe1,The effects of transition style for collaborative view sharing in immersive Virtual Reality,2020,"New low-cost Virtual Reality (VR) technology is enabling large numbers of engineers and designers to be outfitted with VR tools. This, in turn, is making feasible new tools such as immersive, collaborative, design environments that reflect the collaborative environment of drafting tables while still providing all the power of modern, computer-based, design tools. However, before such an environment can be fully realized, basic issues surrounding collaboration in VR such as cybersickness and disorientation must be more fully addressed. This work presents the results of an experimental study conducted to characterize the trade-offs between different styles of transitioning collaborators to a shared view in an immersive virtual environment. The experimental task consisted of asking participants to identify in which quadrant of the car specific components were located. Quadrant identification was performed after a participant's virtual location was transitioned to a shared view location focused on the component to identify. The study was conducted with 45 participants who provided 1890 transition response datapoints. Analysis of these results suggests that, in many cases, collaborators are willing to experience some mild cybersickness in order to reduce their disorientation and improve both confidence and accuracy of component location identification. The results also support the recommendation that the best practice is to provide support for multiple transition styles and allow collaborators to select their preference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.cag.2020.08.003
c30ee9d3-4421-4a88-b6b8-47a59fcc13cd,Probabilistic extension of flexible hybrid state estimation for cyber-physical systems,2020,"This paper proposes a probabilistic extension to flexible hybrid state estimation (FHSE) for cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The main goal of the algorithm is improvement of the system state tracking when realistic communications are taken into account, by optimizing information and communication technology (ICT) usage. These advancements result in: 1) coping with ICT outages and inevitable irregularities (delay, packet drop and bad measurements); 2) determining the optimized state estimation execution frequencies based on expected measurement refresh times. Additionally, information about CPSs is gathered from both the phasor measurement units (PMU) and SCADA-based measurements. This measurement transfer introduces two network observability types, which split the system into observable (White) and unobservable (Grey) areas, based on 1) deployed measuring instruments (MIs) and 2) received measurements. A two-step bad data detection (BDD) method is introduced for ICT irregularities and outages. The proposed algorithm benefits are shown on two IEEE test cases with time-varying load/generation: 14-bus and 300-bus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.106179

A narrow, open channel is etched into a silicon substrate and then a photoresist polymer is introduced into the channel through spontaneous capillary action. The natural concave meniscus formed by the polymer is then covered by a thin chemical vapor deposited membrane. The polymer is removed by sacrificial etching, leaving behind a suspended membrane.

Current industrial methods generally utilize monoethanolamine for CO2 capture; however, the CO2 regeneration requires a high temperature and energy demand during every adsorption/desorption process, along with material losses. Many solid amines with high capture capacity and stability are developed as adsorbents to overcome the limitations. However, the environmental impacts caused by adsorbents themselves are not holistically considered and discussed; meanwhile, material syntheses and consumptions are also associated with CO2 emission. To determine the environmental impacts and identify hotspots of novel CO2 capture adsorbents, two carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine, physically adsorbed and covalently bonded, were compared with traditional monoethanolamine method using life cycle assessment. The carbon payback periods were also analyzed to gain understanding on whether the currently evaluated novel materials are suitable for industrial application. Results suggest that, material usage, especially carbon nanotubes, contributes the majority of the overall environmental impacts for both types of carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine. Meanwhile, their carbon payback periods are over 40 times longer than monoethanolamine during the synthesis phase. However, the energy consumption of physically adsorbed polyethyleneimine saves up to 60% compared to monoethanolamine in every adsorption/desorption cycle due to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the rate of cumulative CO2 remission for carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine is twice higher than monoethanolamine, indicating the potential application for industrial CO2 capture. Overall, our study indicates that current status of solid amine has a potential in CO2 capture, but requires much improvements. Future research should pay attention on decreasing the initial material synthesis and increasing the product life time due to their high environmental tradeoffs. Meanwhile, our study highlights that unilateral emphasis of the CO2 capture efficiency by novel materials may not be adequate, comprehensive considerations should be focused on the comparison throughout material life cycles including use and preparation phases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122465
87fbf45b-cc3d-4c0b-ab39-a14abcf4f5a2,Investigating steel tool life in the RFSSW process,2020,"Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding (RFSSW) has demonstrated capability in joining thin sheets of aluminum with dissimilar thickness, alloy, and composition. The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 °C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings. Following this analysis, future evaluation of less re-active tool materials is recommended. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",10.1016/j.jmapro.2020.07.034

In this letter, we provide a decentralized routing algorithm for coordinating multiple autonomous vehicles as they visit a discrete set of pre-defined targets with weighted revisit priorities. The algorithm utilizes a block coordinate ascent algorithm combined with a Monte Carlo tree search to tractably decide each vehicle's route. The result is a non-myopic algorithm for multiple vehicles that is decentralized, computationally tractable, and allows for target prioritization. Guarantees are provided that all targets will have finite revisit times and that the block coordinate ascent algorithm will converge to a block optimal solution. Numerical simulations illustrate the utility of this method by showing that the results are comparable to those of a centralized exhaustive search and that they degrade gracefully with limited communication and scale under increasing numbers of targets and vehicles. © 2016 IEEE.",10.1109/LRA.2020.3008140
c2c2cc21-801d-4063-88a5-dc12a6b09e7d,In-situ strain measurement of ballistic fabrics during impact using fiber Bragg gratings,2020,"In previous experiments, the authors demonstrated that strain values collected from fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) integrated into a single layer of Kevlar fabric, placed between a soft armor test specimen and backing material, could be related to the time dependent back-face deformation (BFD) of the armor sample. In this paper, we investigate the specific fabric deformation and failure mechanisms that cause observed events in the FBG measured strain behavior and the FBG spectral profile throughout the impact event. For these experiments, the standard clay backing material was replaced with a 20% clear ballistic gel to provide visual access to the back-face. The test specimen was impacted by an 8.24 g steel ball bearing travelling at 248.8 m/s, during which strain was calculated from the measured full spectrum response of the FBG using a high-speed optical interrogation system. The strain response was compared to the BFD of the Kevlar sample. The BFD was measured through the clear ballistic gel using two high speed cameras recording at 100,000 fps. The results from these tests can be used for future testing using a non-transparent backing material to obtain a detailed strain–time history, back-face deformation history and an understanding of the time sequence of physical energy dissipation mechanisms in the fabric. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.yofte.2020.102334

The accuracy of computed solutions over coarse meshes, that have highly non-interpolatory control meshes, is achieved through the application of a continuous rotational approach. The starting point of the formulation is the modified Hellinger–Reissner variational principle with independent displacement, membrane, and shear strains as the unknown fields. To overcome locking, the strain variables are interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases. Leveraging the orthogonality property of the Bézier dual basis, the strain variables are condensed out of the system with only a slight increase in the bandwidth of the resulting linear system. The condensed approach preserves the accuracy of the non-condensed mixed approach but with fewer degrees of freedom. From a practical point of view, since the Bézier dual basis is completely specified through Bézier extraction, any spline space that admits Bézier extraction can utilize the proposed approach directly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.cma.2020.113283

839f3754-fce6-4467-99ec-10ecaaaa9e45,High-Speed Acoustic Impact-Echo Sounding of Concrete Bridge Decks,2020,"Evaluation of deteriorating highway bridges requires new, rapid inspection methods to effectively guide repair in an era of limited fiscal resources. Of all the components of a bridge, the bridge deck typically deteriorates most quickly and must therefore be regularly inspected for non-visible internal cracking, called delamination, for which early detection and repair can enhance safety and performance as well as reduce long-term maintenance costs. This research demonstrates the development and deployment of a multi-channel acoustic impact-echo sounding apparatus equipped with specially-configured tire chains for acoustic excitation of the concrete, microphones, an array of sensors for establishing spatial position estimates, and a data processing architecture for accurately detecting and mapping delaminations in concrete bridge decks at high speeds. The new apparatus achieved very accurate results at speeds between 25 and 45 km/h across a bridge deck.

In this work, an experimental prototype of this concept is realized and its performance is analyzed. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of maintaining a spacecraft component at a desired operating temperature through the expansion and contraction of a collapsible radiator to control radiative heat loss. Four aluminum panels are connected via a flexible hinge constructed from interwoven copper wires and suspended from an actuating framework. The radiator panels are connected to a heated aluminum block. The radiator is placed in a vacuum environment with cooled surroundings (173 K) and the total radiative cooling power is determined as a function of radiator actuation position for a constant aluminum block temperature. As the radiator actuates from extended to collapsed, the heat transfer decreases and the fin efficiency increases. For a limited actuation range, the four-panel radiator exhibits a turn-down ratio (largest cooling power / smallest cooling power) of 1.31. A numerical model validated in this work predicts a turn-down ratio of 2.27 for actuation over the full range of radiator positions in surroundings at 4 K. Future revisions that exhibit an increase in panel and hinge thermal conductivities and utilizing eight panels would yield a turn-down ratio of 6.01. Assuming infinite thermal conductivity and infinite hinge conductance, the turn-down ratios for two, four and eight panel radiators, respectively, are 2.00, 3.98, and 7.92. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115658
b3ec8328-8003-4af8-99b5-7fd1912be5d5,A new approach of reduction of carbon dioxide emission and optimal use of carbon and hydrogen content for the desired syngas production from coal,2020,"This research is designed to make progress in overcoming the challenges through the development of a two-stage coal processing. Specifically, a two-stage process was used to maximize the use of the carbon in coal or increase the carbon monoxide yield or lower carbon dioxide and methane yields. Carbon dioxide-char gasification in the absence of water can generate carbon monoxide with near-zero methane, which is desired to produce high-carbon and low-hydrogen chemicals such as oxalic acid through catalytic carbon monoxide coupling and hydrolysis. The technology is applicable to any coal, although Power River Basin (PRB) coal is used as an example feedstock in this research Also, the sodium-iron catalyst can accelerate not only the reaction kinetics in both stages but also increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio in the syngas produced in the second stage. In other words, the catalyst is a multifunctional agent, which can not only intensify the overall coal process efficiency but also improve the qualities of the desired syngas products and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Thus, In the 1st stage, the catalysts can significantly reduce the CO2-char gasification by as high as 75.00%. In the 2nd stage, the H2/CO ratio of ideal syngas is ∼2:1 with near-0 CH4 generation and the CH4 production can be reduced as high as 61.29% for the CO2–H2O-Char coal gasification. The activation energy for the 2nd stage is reduced by as high as 35.43% than that of raw coal without use Na–Fe catalyst. The overall carbon footprint reduction for the study is reduced by 87.33% in the 1st stage and 96.77% compared to the direct coal combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121786

ec354951-600d-436d-aa7b-ce27e595ec72,Relative multiplicative extended Kalman filter for observable GPS-denied navigation,2020,"This work presents a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) for estimating the relative state of a multirotor vehicle operating in a GPS-denied environment. The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date. This article presents several improvements and extensions to the filter while clearly defining all quaternion conventions and properties used, including several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this article derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicle’s body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/0278364920903094

81d82eb9-b897-4569-8946-5c7c35ec12e8,"Social impact in product design, an exploration of current industry practices",2020,"Though academic research for identifying and considering the social impact of products is emerging, additional insights can be gained from engineers who design products every day. This paper explores current practices in industries used by design engineers to consider the social impact of products. Forty-six individuals from 34 different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a product's social impact. These interviews were also used to discover how social impact might be considered in a design setting moving forward. This is not a study to find “the state of the art,” but considers the average engineering professional's work to design products in various industries. Social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common processes discussed in the literature to evaluate social impact, both generally and in products. Interestingly, these processes did not arise in any discussion in interviews, despite respondents affirming that they do consider social impact in the product design. Processes used to predict social impact, rather than simply evaluate, were discussed by the respondents. These tended to be developed within the company and often related to industry imposed government regulations. To build on this study, the findings herein should be further validated for executives, managers, and engineers. A study specific to these roles should be designed to understand the disconnect better. Additionally, processes should be developed to assist engineers in considering the social impact of their products. Work should also be done to help educate engineers and their leaders on the value of considering the social impact in product design. Copyright © 2019 by ASME",10.1115/1.4045448
644b5ae7-bb99-4ec2-b530-65e032829eaf,An iterative pose estimation algorithm based on epipolar geometry with application to multi-target tracking,2020,"This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating the relative pose of a moving camera using consecutive frames of a video sequence. State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware. We show application of our algorithm to visual multi-target tracking (MTT) in the presence of parallax and demonstrate its real-time performance on a 640 480 video sequence captured on a UAV. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",10.1109/JAS.2020.1003222
469da8cf-7bc1-41fa-824d-1dada092bd03,Tracking joint angles during whole-arm movements using electromagnetic sensors,2020,"Electromagnetic (EM) motion tracking systems are suitable for many research and clinical applications, including in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements. Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods. It is hoped that this paper will simplify new investigations of whole-arm movement using EM sensors and facilitate comparison between studies. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Peak radiated noise levels correlate with the time when the valve opens and closes, while the noise levels when the valve is completely open are also relatively high. Significant noise ranges between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz. It was hypothesized that increasing the in-tube distance between the flush valve and the bowl in addition to increasing the bend radius of the tube would reduce radiated noise levels. These modifications resulted in a reduction of about 14 dB in the radiated noise during the valve opening and closing in addition to a reduction of about 5 dB while the valve is completely opened. Intermediate results of varying the tube length and bend radius are presented to show their effects on the radiated sound levels. Two tube inserts were designed to fit (1) underneath and (2) behind the toilet in a compact manner. They were tested to show that they maintain noise control performance without modifying any other part of the toilet. © 2020 Institute of Noise Control Engineering. © 2020 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

At the same time, due to their high level of design flexibility, reprogrammable capability, low power consumption, and relatively low cost, the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are very good candidates to implement the neural networks. Unfortunately, the radiation-induced errors are known to be an issue in static random-access memory (SRAM)-based FPGAs. More specifically, we have seen that particles can change the content of the FPGA's configuration memory, consequently corrupting the implemented circuit and generating the observable errors at the output. Through extensive fault injection, we determine the reliability impact of applying binary quantization to the convolutional layers of neural networks on FPGAs, by analyzing the relationships between model accuracy, resource utilization, performance, error criticality, and radiation cross section. We were able to find that a design with quantized convolutional layers can be 39% less sensitive to radiation, whereas the portion of errors that are considered critical (misclassifications) in the network is increased by 12%. Moreover, we also derive generic equations that consider both accuracy and radiation in order to model the overall failure rate of neural networks. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TNS.2020.2983662

This system is modelled by the Network Simulator 2 software tool, which is also used to calculate communication delays and packet drop probabilities. Within this setup, the system observability can be predicted, and the proposed SE can decide between using the static SE (SSE) or the discrete Kalman filter plus SSE-based measurements and time alignment (Forecasting-aided SE). Flexible hybrid SE (FHSE) incorporates both phasor measurement units and supervisory control and data acquisition-based measurements, with different time stamps. The proposed FHSE with detailed modelling of the communication system is motivated by: (i) well-known issues in SSE (time alignment of the measurements, frequent un-observability for fixed SE time stamps etc.); and (ii) the need to model a realistic communication system (calculated communication delays and packet drop probabilities are a part of the proposed FHSE). Application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated for examples with time-varying bus load/generation on two IEEE test cases: 14-bus and 300-bus. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1148

Resolution IV 2 (Formula presented.) fractional factorial designs are efficient and require fewer experiments or runs than resolution V or full factorial experiments. However, two-factor interactions are confounded with other two-factor interactions in resolution IV designs and their effects cannot be separated. Follow-up experiments have been recommended in the literature to separate the effects of significant but confounded strings of two-factor interactions in resolution IV designs. Recently, an analysis based on conditional main effects (or CMEs) has been shown to be useful in determining which interaction in a confounded string of two-factor interactions is actually causing the significance without the need for follow-up experiments. In this article, I investigate the value of this method of analysis by comparing its use with the analysis of follow-up experiments using the data from three published experiments where follow-up experiments were used to “de-alias” confounded interactions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/qre.2638

Because the MMSE equalizer filter coefficients are a function of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), the equivalent discrete-time channel, and the noise variance, reliable estimates of those parameters are required. The CFO is due primarily to the high velocity of the airborne transmitter. Because the equivalent discrete-time channel in aeronautical telemetry is sparse, the performance of the joint estimator based on a sparse channel estimator is superior to the performance of a traditional nonsparse maximum-likelihood-inspired joint estimator. The improvement is seen in lower estimator error variances for the parameters, particularly for the CFO and channel estimate, and in the postequalizer bit-error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the postequalizer bit-error rate using the sparse estimator is almost as good as that using ideal estimators. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",10.1109/TAES.2020.2972245

The development of an odometry-like, front-end, EKF-based estimator that utilizes only a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The filter uses the measurement model of the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter. The filter also regularly resets its origin in coordination with the declaration of keyframe images. The keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates and their covariances are sent to a global back end that represents the global state as a pose graph. The back end is better suited to represent nonlinear uncertainties and incorporate opportunistic global constraints. We also introduce a method to account for front-end velocity bias in the back-end optimization. The paper provides simulation and hardware flight-test results of the front-end estimator and performs several back-end optimizations on the front-end data. © 2020 Institute of Navigation",10.1002/navi.364

Characterization of residual stress using neutron and x-ray diffraction result in bulk and grain level residual stress measurements; however, the contribution of the microscale residual strain remains largely unaccounted for. High-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) has emerged as a promising tool for the characterization of such micron-level elastic strains. This work presents an early effort in analysis of microscale elastic strain in conjunction with subgrain dislocation structures to further the understanding of microstructural evolution during laser additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. Elastic strain in DMLS fabricated IN625 is analyzed using open source cross-correlation software OpenXY while the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density is calculated from EBSD data using the Nye tensor. Dislocation structures previously seen in similar materials are shown here to contain low elastic strain gradients, supporting the assertion that these structures occur as strain minimization mechanisms during solidification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2020.139380

The creation of stable water TLFs, however, is very difficult. In this paper, the realization of thin liquid films of water with custom 3D geometries that persist indefinitely in ambient environments is reported. The wetting films are generated using microscale “mounts” fed by microfluidic channels with small feature sizes and large aspect ratios. These devices are fabricated with a custom 3D printer and resin, which are developed to print high resolution microfluidic geometries. By modifying the 3D-printed polymer to be hydrophilic and taking advantage of well-known wetting principles and capillary effects, self-sustaining microscale “water fountains” are constructed that continuously replenish water lost to evaporation while relying on surface tension to stabilize their shape.

4fe012f1-1e7d-4602-8199-bec8467a59d2,Impact of part thickness and drying conditions on saturation limits in binder jet additive manufacturing,2020,"Binder jetting (BJ) is a high build-rate additive manufacturing process with growing commercial interest. Growth in BJ applications is driven by the use of finer powders and improved post-processing methods that can produce dense, homogenous final parts. However, understanding of the basic droplet/powder interaction is relatively limited. This paper considers the impact of in-process drying, part geometry, and droplet size on a key printing parameter: binder saturation. Parts of varying thicknesses are printed with a range of saturation levels under various heating conditions. The ratio of the printed part mass to the theoretical part mass is used to detect bleeding. In unheated powder beds, part mass increases linearly with printing saturation levels across the range tested (30 %–130 %). However, when the powder is heated between layers, there is a wide range of print saturation levels (30–80 %) over which increasing binder saturation or droplet volume does not increase the part mass. This stable part mass corresponds to accurate part geometries without bleeding and is likely due to enhanced evaporation of the binder solvent between layers. Smaller droplet volume (42 pl) was also shown to decrease saturation levels in unheated powder bed and in single layer parts. The differences in part mass with print saturation and droplet volume are most pronounced in thin parts. These observations lead to a simple method for determining an appropriate print saturation parameter for a powder/binder combination in thick parts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.addma.2020.101127

Nanorod attachment to DNA origami was via DNA hybridization for Au and by electrostatic interaction for Te. Electroless gold plating was used to create nanoscale metal—semiconductor interfaces by filling the gaps between Au and Te nanorods. Two-point electrical characterization indicated that the Au—Te—Au junctions were electrically connected, with current—voltage properties consistent with a Schottky junction.

To explain this, it has been observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to specialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based on this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most well-known topological features found in real-world networks including right-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as hierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this model also effects the spectral properties of a network. This allows us to give the conditions under which a network is able to maintain its dynamics as its topology evolves. Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability, then the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This is one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types of dynamics exhibited by networks. These are the dynamics of a network, which is the topological evolution of the network's structure, modeled here by the process of network specialization, and the dynamics on a network, which is the changing state of the network elements, where the type of dynamics we consider is global stability. The main examples we apply our results to are recurrent neural networks, which are the basis of certain types of machine learning algorithms. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/S0218127420500911

Both NPS-PEGDA and avobenzone-PEGDA (A-PEGDA) resins were evaluated for cytotoxicity and cell adhesion. We show that NPS-PEGDA can be made effectively noncytotoxic with a postprint 12 h ethanol wash, and that A-PEGDA, as-printed, is effectively noncytotoxic. 3D prints made with either resin do not support strong cell adhesion in their as-printed state; however, cell adhesion increases dramatically with a short plasma treatment. Using A-PEGDA, we demonstrate spheroid formation in ultralow adhesion 3D printed wells, and cell migration from spheroids on plasma-treated adherent surfaces.

In order for RFSSW to become a readily implementable welding solution, cycle times must be reduced to an acceptable level, similar to that of well developed, competing spot joining processes. In the present work, an investigation of the RFSSW process is conducted to evaluate factors that have traditionally prevented the process from achieving fast cycle times. Within this investigation, the relationship between cycle time and joint quality is explored, as is the meaning and measurement of cycle time in the RFSSW process. Claims and general sentiment found in prior literature are challenged regarding the potential for high-speed RFSSW joints to be made. The RFSSW weld design-as described by process parameters such as tool feed rate, tool rotational velocity, and plunge depth-is shown through experimentation to affect the loads and torques placed on RFSSW tooling and machines during the welding process. As cycle time is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset are shown to increase. Similarly, as tool rotational velocity is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset is shown to increase. The relationship between machine design limitations and cycle time is also explored. It is demonstrated that welds with cycle times below one second can be produced without compromising material properties, suggesting that high speed RFSSW can be enabled through informed efforts. © 2020 SAE International.

ad955955-d618-407b-a9c7-5f406f62af7a,A Method for Creating Product Social Impact Models of Engineered Products,2020,"All products impact the lives of their users, this is called social impact. Some social impacts are commonly recognized by the engineering community, such as impacts to a user's health and safety, while other social impacts can be more difficult to recognize, such as impacts on families and gender roles. When engineers make design decisions, without considering social impacts, they can unknowingly cause negative social impacts. Even harming the user and/or society. Despite its challenges, measuring a program's or policy's social impact is a common practice in the field of social sciences. These measurements are made using social impact indicators, which are simply the things observed to verify that true progress is being made. While there are clear benefits to predicting the social impact of an engineered product, it is unclear how engineers should select indicators and build predictive social impact models that are functions of engineering parameters and decisions. This paper introduces a method for selecting social impact indicators and creating predictive social impact models that can help engineers predict and improve the social impact of their products. As a first step in the method, an engineer identifies the product's users, objectives, and requirements. Then, the social impact categories that are related to the product are determined.

ec1411dc-1265-4e7b-926d-39f5ab382e28,Real-Time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Robots Using a Graphics Processing Unit,2020,"In past robotics applications, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has often been limited to linear models and relatively short time horizons. In recent years however, research in optimization, optimal control, and simulation has enabled some forms of nonlinear model predictive control which find locally optimal solutions. The limiting factor for applying nonlinear MPC for robotics remains the computation necessary to solve the optimization, especially for complex systems and for long time horizons. This letter presents a new solution method which addresses computational concerns related to nonlinear MPC called nonlinear Evolutionary MPC (NEMPC), and then we compare it to several existing methods. These comparisons include simulations on torque-limited robots performing a swing-up task and demonstrate that NEMPC is able to discover complex behaviors to accomplish the task. Comparisons with state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC algorithms show that NEMPC finds high quality control solutions very quickly using a global, instead of local, optimization method. Finally, an application in hardware (a 24 state pneumatically actuated continuum soft robot) demonstrates that this method is tractable for real-time control of high degree of freedom systems. © 2016 IEEE.",10.1109/LRA.2020.2965393

A novel approach is taken to overcome challenges presented by multiple clock domains, the use of third-party IP, and the collection of error detection signals dispersed throughout the design. Novel fault injection techniques are also used to evaluate critical regions of the target design. Accelerated neutron radiation testing was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied technique.

Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic focusing was implemented in 10-μm scale microchannel cross-sections made with a single sacrificial layer. HDF is achieved using buffer fluid to sheath the sample fluid, requiring four fluid ports to operate by pressure driven flow. A low-pressure chamber, or pit, formed by etching into a substrate, enables volumetric flow ratio-induced focusing at a low flow velocity. The single layer design simplifies surface micromachining and improves device yield by 1.56 times over previous work. The focusing design was integrated with optical waveguides and used in order to analyze fluorescent signals from beads in fluid flow. The implementation of the focusing scheme was found to narrow the distribution of bead velocity and fluorescent signal, giving rise to 33% more consistent signal. Reservoir effects were observed at low operational vacuum pressures and a balance between optofluidic signal variance and intensity was achieved. The implementation of the design in optofluidic sensors will enable higher detection sensitivity and sample specificity. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/MI11040349

For this purpose, ODT is extended in two ways. First, a forcing scheme that maintains statistical stationarity is introduced. Unlike direct numerical simulation (DNS) of forced turbulence, the ODT framework accommodates forcing that is not directly coupled to the momentum equation. For given forcing the ODT energy dissipation rate is therefore the same in particle-laden cases as in the corresponding single-phase reference case. Second, previously implemented one-way-coupled particle phenomenology is extended to two-way coupling using the general ODT methodology for flow modulation through interaction with any specified energy and momentum sources and sinks. As in a DNS comparison case for Reλ=70, turbulence modulation is diagnosed primarily on the basis of the fluid-phase kinetic-energy spectrum. Because ODT involves subprocesses with straightforward physical interpretations, the ODT mechanisms of particle-induced turbulence modulation are clearly identified and they are plausibly relevant to particle-laden Navier-Stokes turbulence. ODT results for the ratio of particle-phase and fluid-phase kinetic energies as a function of particle Stokes number and mass loading are reported for the purpose of testing these predictions in the future when these quantities are evaluated experimentally or using DNS. © 2020 authors.

The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated. The present study offers a parametric nonlinear lateral force-displacement backbone curve for BATBs that is verified against three-dimensional finite-element models and validated against data from large-scale tests conducted at Brigham Young University. The parametric curve takes backwall height as well as abutment skew angle into account. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0001533

However, its complete oxidation has been a challenge. Dimethyl viologen, as an electron mediator, has been shown to promote high levels of glucose oxidation under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, the efficiency of viologen-mediated glucose oxidation has been low in electrochemical experiments. In this study, viologen-mediated oxidation of glucose was investigated under anaerobic electrochemical conditions to understand the factors that impact the oxidation efficiency. Of particular interest was the improvement of electrochemical oxidation for glucose fuel cell applications. An experimental cell was developed to electrochemically reoxidize the mediator as it was homogeneously reduced by glucose under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, the mediator was reoxidized by direct reaction with oxygen under aerobic conditions. The aerobic oxidation efficiency was 75%, three times larger than the maximum efficiency in the electrochemical cell. 13C-NMR results show that the main product formed under aerobic conditions was formic acid, whereas glycolic acid was the principal product formed in the electrochemical cell. Carbonate was only formed under aerobic conditions. Therefore, the use of oxygen to reoxidize the mediator also directly influenced the glucose oxidation pathway. In the electrochemical cell, the oxidation efficiency depended on the electrochemical reaction rate of the mediator and was higher at faster rates. The efficiency also depended on the initial molar ratio of the mediator to glucose. The maximum oxidation efficiency of glucose in the electrochemical cell was approximately 22%, which is about three times larger than the maximum efficiency for precious-metal-based anodes. © 2019",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114382

To tolerate the severe variations in the subthreshold regime, a novel dynamic bulk biasing circuit senses the NMOS/PMOS strength ratio in the background and applies feedback to recover the circuit functionality. A new comparator relaxes the stringent speed-noise trade-off under the 0.2-V supply. Employing ac-coupling, stacked input pairs, and voltage-boosted load capacitors, the comparator achieves more than threefold improvement in speed with little noise penalty. The measured ADC consumes 22 nW and exhibits an SNDR of 52.8 dB at Nyquist, yielding an FoM of 12.3 fJ/conv.-step.

In particular, martensite and other brittle microstructures often form in steels during rotary friction welding (FW). In order to address this, cooling rate and temperature control is developed for FW. Limits of achievable FW cooling rates are primarily determined by thermal and geometric properties such as thermal diffusivity and length. A controller limits interface temperatures during a weld preheat, changing the thermal profile and slowing post-weld cooling. This method is demonstrated in 1045 steel. Cooling simulations, TTT diagrams, microhardness line scans, and scanning electron microscopy are used for analysis. Without temperature and cooling rate control, martensite readily forms after a weld. With temperature and cooling rate control, martensitic transformations are completely avoided and a pearlitic microstructure is developed. Temperature and cooling rate control is a viable tool in designing post-weld microstructures within achievable cooling rate limitations. © 2019",10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2019.103512

The unusual inverse piezoresistive behavior of the sensors has been modeled using quantum tunneling and percolation theory. However, the impact of the distribution of conductive particles in the matrix, and specifically their relative orientation, has not been well studied. The initial and deformed distribution of orientations greatly influences the sensor behavior, since the quantum tunneling model is highly sensitive to the polymer gaps between nanoparticles; the evolution of these gaps under deformation is strongly dependent upon the relative orientation of neighboring particles, and determines electron transport properties, and overall sensor response. In this paper a simple analytical model for isotropic orientation distribution and subsequent Poisson-based gap evolution is compared with a more sophisticated finite element and random resistor network analysis. The new numerical model was able to explain previously unexplained physical behavior and is used to design sensors with specific desired characteristics. The appropriateness of the previously assumed percolation behavior is also examined via the model and generalized effective medium theory. © 2020",10.1016/j.sna.2020.111851

The contact phenomenon of CCMs increases the difficulties of their analysis and design, especially when they exhibit beam-to-beam contact. Considering the particularity of CCMs analysis, which is more about the mechanisms’ deformation, this paper presents a numerical method to analyze the large deflection and stress of the CCMs considering beam-to-beam contacts. Based on our previous work on beam-to-rigid contact, the large deformation of general beams in CCMs is modeled by using the chained pseudo-rigid-body model (CPRBM). An approximation based on the geometric information of CPRBM is proposed in this paper to rapidly determine the moving boundary curve for beam-to-beam contact constraints. The static equilibrium configuration of CCMs is solved by minimizing its potential energy function under the geometric constraints from the boundary curves of contacts. A formulation is also provided to evaluate the normal stress along the deformed beam based on the deformation of CPRBM's torsional springs. Numerical examples and finite element analysis are used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2019.103700

Biomass ash contents vary substantially among fuel types and are typified by the three fuels compared in this investigation. These fuels have ash-content ratios of about 40:1, which should allow experimental observation of ash effects. In addition, the experiments explore char gasification rates under kinetically controlled conditions that should highlight the effects of ash. By contrast, diffusion controlled burning rates may mask the types of ash effects observed here. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that refractory material such as ash reduces kinetic reaction rates by rendering portions of the surface area inert as char burnout proceeds and ash content increases. Ash also affects particle size in a somewhat compensatory manner. A theoretical model has been developed to quantify the ash effect. This model indicates that all chars from ash-forming fuels should experience similar behavior, which manifests itself as a decrease in the kinetic burning rate in late stages of burnout even though the kinetic reactivity of the char does not change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114358

Recently Wisesa et al. (2016) and Morgan et al. (2018) demonstrated that generalized regular (GR) grids offer an advantage over traditional MP grids. The difference is simple but effective. At the same k-point density, GR grids have greater symmetry and 60% fewer irreducible k-points. GR grids have not been widely adopted because one must search through a large number of candidate grids; in many cases, a brute force search could take hours. This work describes an algorithm that can quickly search over GR grids for those that have the most uniform distribution of points and the best symmetry reduction. The grids are ∼60% more efficient, on average, than MP grids and can now be generated on the fly in seconds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109340

The reported device is capable of heating and cooling rates exceeding 8000 °C/min and can reach temperatures of 350 °C. The control methods allow for excellent disturbance rejection and precision to within +/- 1 °C.

Experimental bicrystals can be difficult or expensive to fabricate, and computational constraints limit atomistic bicrystal simulations to high-symmetry GBs (i.e., those with small enough GB periodicity). Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structure–property models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structure–property models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structure–property model is unknown. We present an idealized case study in which GB structure–property models for diffusivity are inferred from noisy simulation results of two-dimensional microstructures, under the assumption that the number of polycrystal measurements available is larger than the number of parameters in the inferred model.

The surface temperature is uniform and is greater than the temperature of the surrounding liquid. Uniform stream-wise hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump were imposed at the wall to model the SHPo surface. Applying an integral analysis within the boundary layer results in a system of differential equations, which was solved numerically to obtain boundary layer thickness and local and average values of the Nusselt number. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous analyses of the same problem. Solutions were obtained for laminar Rayleigh number ranging from 104 to 109 at a Prandtl number of 7. There was a modest decrease in the boundary layer thickness due to the increased slip length and the flow velocity decreased due to the increased temperature jump length. The local Nusselt number decreased as the temperature jump length increased, with greater reduction at larger Rayleigh numbers and near the lower edge. The decrease in the average Nusselt number relative to surfaces with no-slip and no temperature jump may be as much as 50%. © 2019",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.119031

One method to enable this adaptivity is to select the most representative model from a set of “pre-aged” models that represent the characteristics of the cell as different cyclic and calendar aging processes occur. By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process, an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM) can be utilized to determine a time-varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation. While the output of the IMM is useful by itself, its predictions can be improved by post-processing. In this paper, we present methods to analyze the time-series probability mass function produced by the IMM using the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms in common use in the digital-communications discipline. These algorithms seek to identify the “best path” through the space of available models over time, based on the likelihoods produced by the IMM and the Markovian transition probabilities.

A discrete ordinates method is used to solve the radiative heat transfer equation with radiative properties calculated using a weighted-sum-of-grey-gases (WSGG) model for gases and Mie and Rayleigh theory for particles including fuel, ash and soot. Measurement data gathered from a pilot-scale test furnace, comprising temperature, gas composition and particle concentration, is used in combination with temperature data and operation parameters gathered from a conventional rotary kiln to model a full-scale rotary kiln with a present bed material. The modelled cases have a thermal input of about 37 MWth and in addition to radiative heat transfer, conductive heat transfer within, as well as between, the bed and wall material are included in the model along with convective heat transfer from the gas and heat release from exothermic reactions in the bed.

Four large-grained tantalum tensile specimens were strained in uniaxial tension, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data were collected, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) maps of the four specimens in the unloaded state were produced. EBSD-based GND maps revealed several types of features with high GND content which caused back stress in the specimens. Correlations between five geometrically-based grain boundary (GB) transmission factors and the GB GND content were evaluated, and statistically significant correlations were found for transmission factors based on Livingston and Chalmer's N factor, Werner and Prantl's slip transfer number, and GB misorientation. The sign of individual components of the Nye tensor were used to visually and quantitatively identify clustering of GNDs of the same sign, thus giving additional evidence of increasing back stress due to deformation. Deformation of one of the specimens was simulated using multiple CPFEM based modeling approaches and predicted stress-strain responses are compared. The super dislocation model (SD model) — a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) which incorporates elastic dislocation interactions — was able to isolate impact of back stress on the overall flow stress. The SD model predicted correct stresses when compared with experimental data; however, when the elastic interactions in the SD model were turned off, stress predictions were 25% too low. Thus, demonstrating the importance of incorporating back stress into the model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2019.138704

The authors investigate the relationships between survey speed and reflector geometry, array layout, element spacing and element configuration using numerical simulations, to determine the values of these parameters that lead to optimal system performance. They characterise the array element spacing that leads to maximum survey speed as a function of the reflector f/D. To further improve survey speed in relation to the overall number of array elements, the authors explore the possibility of using elements with modest levels of superdirectivity to sample more of the focal plane Airy pattern and increase optimal spacing for survey speed figure of merit. The results explain how optimal survey speed is controlled primarily by the influence of element type and array layout on the peak achievable aperture efficiency. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",10.1049/el.2019.2591

The moderately hydrophobic drug latanoprost was rapidly loaded in 4 min by swelling contact lenses in a solution of the drug in n-propanol. A fraction of the drug was radiolabeled, thus allowing measurement of the uptake and subsequent release of drug into artificial tear fluid. Three questions were addressed: (1) how much drug can be loaded into each type of lens, (2) how fast is drug release, and (3) how are these values related to the contact lens chemistry. The results showed that much more latanoprost could be loaded into SiHy lenses than a conventional contact lens of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The drug uptake correlated with the amount of swelling in n-propanol, with Galyfilcon lenses having the greatest swelling and highest drug uptake. The drug release from the SiHy lenses occurred over days, whereas the conventional lens released nearly all drug in a burst over a few hours. To examine correlations between lens chemistry, drug chemistry and uptake, and solvent chemistry, the Hansen solubility parameters were calculated using estimates of contact lens chemistry. These results showed that drug uptake in SiHy lenses correlated with favorable solubility parameter interactions between the n-propanol and the lens material, but did not correlate with interactions between the drug and the lens materials. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/09205063.2019.1669126

The most significant roadblock to industry’s implementation of LCM is the usually higher void content compared with prepreg processing. One tool for reducing void levels in LCM involves optimization of flow velocity, which requires models to be developed to describe void formation at a given velocity. To help solve this problem, the following research illustrates the first known method for optical void measurement in situ during infusion in a carbon fiber reinforcement. Similar to previous studies on glass fiber, this work utilizes fluorescent dye and a digital camera to produce sufficient contrast and resolution for image analysis. Visible bubbles are photographed against the opaque carbon fiber background. An automated method of image analysis is outlined, which was used to analyze 230 images for three different flow orientations of a single fabric, producing the highest amount of experimental data seen so far on in situ void measurement. The resulting data identifies a minimum velocity threshold for minimal macro-void formation. The resultant void characterization framework will better enable optimization of LCM processing for high-performance composites based on carbon reinforcements. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/0021998320959820

Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or ‘reasoning in the linguistic domain’. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-52246-9_44

4153e2c7-7285-4635-adb4-7d43c897e51c,Modeling common cause failures in systems with triple modular redundancy and repair,2020,"Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is commonly employed to increase the reliability and mean time to failure (MTTF) of a system. This improvement can be shown by using a continuous time Markov chain. However, typical Markov chain models do not model common cause failures (CCF), which is a singular event that simultaneously causes failure in multiple redundant modules. This paper introduces a new Markov chain to model CCF in TMR with repair systems. This new model is compared to the idealized models of TMR with repair without CCF. The fundamental limitations that CCF imposes on the system are shown and discussed. In a motivating example, it is seen that CCF imposes a limitation of 51× on the reliability improvement in a system with TMR and repair compared to a simplex system, (i.e., without TMR). A case study is also presented where the likelihood of CCF is reduced by a factor of 18× using various mitigation techniques. Reducing the CCF compounds the reliability improvement of TMR with repair and leads to a overall system reliability improvement of 10,000× compared to the simplex system as supported by the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.",10.1109/RAMS48030.2020.9153662

The inflatable joints used in this article consist of a strong fabric exterior that constrains two opposing compliant air bladders that generate torque (unlike McKibben actuators where pressure changes cause translation). This antagonistic structure allows the simultaneous control of position and stiffness. However, dynamic models of soft robots that allow variable stiffness control have not been well developed. In this work, a model that includes stiffness as a state variable is developed and validated. Using the stiffness model, a sliding mode controller and model predictive controller are developed to control stiffness and position simultaneously. For sliding mode control (SMC), the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.07 Nm/rad of a 45 Nm/rad command. For model predictive control (MPC) the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.045 Nm/rad of the same stiffness command. Both SMC and MPC were able to control to within 0.5° of a desired position at steady state. Stiffness control was extended to a multiple-degree-of-freedom soft robot using MPC. Controlling stiffness of a 4-DOF arm reduced the end-effector deflection by approximately 50% (from 17.9 to 12.2cm) with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) step input applied at the end effector when higher joint stiffness (40 Nm/rad) was used compared with low stiffness (30 Nm/rad). This work shows that the derived stiffness model can enable effective position and stiffness control. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/0278364920911960

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Permitted phasing allows vehicles to turn left after yielding to opposing vehicles; protected phasing provides an exclusive phase for vehicles to turn left without opposition; and protected-permitted phasing combines these phasing alternatives, allowing both permitted and protected turning movements. Intersections with 1, 2, and 3 opposing-lane configurations with permitted and protected-permitted models (split into green times of 10, 15, and 20 s) were analyzed for a total of 12 simulation models. Each model was divided into 100–225 different volume scenarios, with incremental increases in left-turn and opposing volumes. By exporting trajectory files from VISSIM and importing these into the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model, crossing conflicts for each volume combination in each model were extracted. MATLAB was then used to create contour maps representing the number of crossing conflicts per hour associated with different combinations of left-turn and opposing volume. Basic decision boundaries were examined in each contour map. Statistical analysis software was used to perform a linear regression analysis on transformed data and to develop natural log-based equations that form the decision boundaries for each configuration and phase alternative. These equations were graphed and final decision boundaries developed for the 1-, 2-, and 3-lane configurations between permitted and protected-permitted phasing as well as between protected-permitted and protected phasing. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",10.1177/0361198120915470

fea2dfd1-0724-4cd0-b480-710d98646c0c,Simulation and Emulation of X-Ray Diffraction from Dynamic Compression Experiments,2020,"Many important aspects of the dynamic thermo-mechanical response of materials occur at the mesoscale, i.e. a physical scale of interactions smaller than what can be adequately described by homogenous behaviors, yet larger than the scale of the atomic lattice. Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model. As a model problem, we consider the dynamic response of the energetic molecular crystal, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (or RDX), under dynamic compression induced by simulated flyer plate impact experiments. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",10.1007/s40870-020-00254-8

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L∕W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties. © 2020 by John Salmon.

The nonlinear parameter extracted in NRUS is based on the dependence of the resonance frequency on vibration amplitude in the presence of damage. NRUS measurements typically are excited with a piezoelectric transducer, but here the application of an electromagnetic transducer is explored as an alternative. The electromagnetic transducer, unlike a single piezoelectric, allows selective excitation of longitudinal, torsional, and bending vibrations in a rod-shaped sample. Measurement of the nonlinear properties of the sample for each type of vibration is therefore possible. This electromagnetic technique involves gluing a coil of wire onto the end of a rod sample and placing it in a magnetic field. By controlling which part of the coil is inside the strongest region of the magnetic field, the principal direction of the driven oscillations in the rod can be controlled. Both piezoelectric and electromagnetic excitation techniques are tested by measuring the parameter of nonlinearity for longitudinal motion, αE, in a sample of Berea sandstone.

The proposed device may be useful for applications requiring a revolute joint that behaves differently when deflecting clockwise/anti-clockwise. The presence of the contact pair reduces the free length of one flexures, resulting in a considerable increment of the overall joint stiffness. The pivot behaviour is investigated, for different load cases, via the Chained-Beam-Constraint Model (CBCM), namely an accurate method to be applied in large deflection problems. A framework comprising Matlab and ANSYS is developed for testing the CAFP performances in terms of rotational stiffness, parasitic shift and maximum stress, with different combinations of geometrical aspect ratios and contact extensions. Results achieved via CBCM for a pure rotation applied to the CAFP's output link are then verified through Finite Element Analysis. The resulting performance maps show good agreement between the numerical results. Furthermore, the CBCM shows an improved computational efficiency, which is a crucial aspect for preliminary design steps.

However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made.

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting.

d6bf8387-7545-4e2f-8203-46bb9aa1f371,Cooperative relative navigation of multiple aircraft in global positioning system-denied/degraded environments,2020,"This paper introduces a method for enabling multiple small unmannedaircraft to improve navigational accuracy in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments by cooperatively sharing information. The method uses a multilevel framework called relative navigation and visual-inertial odometry: Both of which have been used for singlevehicle GPS-denied navigation. This work modifies the relative navigation architecture by adding the necessary elements to enable decentralized, cooperative operations. The proposed framework also includes the ability to incorporate intervehicle measurements and uses a new concept called the coordinated reset, which is necessary for optimizing the cooperative odometry and improving localization. A simple communication protocol is presented, as well as flight-test results that show its effectiveness. The method is first demonstrated in simulation, including Monte Carlo testing, to show the expected improvement gained from cooperation. Finally, results from hardware testing are presented that show the ability of the system to reject initialization errors, to operate with temporary communications dropouts, and to greatly reduce the total amount of shared data compared to a naive approach. The proposed method is able to improve both global navigation accuracy and the accuracy of the relative aircraft positions for missions that require formation flying. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Therefore, a convolutional neural network based on complex networks (CNNBCN) with a modified activation function for the magnetic resonance imaging classification of brain tumors is presented. The network structure is not manually designed and optimized, but is generated by randomly generated graph algorithms. These randomly generated graphs are mapped into a computable neural network by a network generator. The accuracy of the modified CNNBCN model for brain tumor classification reaches 95.49%, which is higher than several models presented by other works. In addition, the test loss of brain tumor classification of the modified CNNBCN model is lower than those of the ResNet, DenseNet and MobileNet models in the experiments. The modified CNNBCN model not only achieves satisfactory results in brain tumor image classification, but also enriches the methodology of neural network design. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993618

Typically, this approach requires some form of protection to ensure that the software can tolerate radiation upsets without compromising the system. Our recent work, COmpiler Assisted Software fault Tolerance (COAST), provides automated compiler modification of software programs to insert dual-or triple-modular redundancy. In this article, we extend COAST to support several new processing platforms, including RISC-V and Xilinx, San Jose, CA, USA, SoC-based products. The automated software protection mechanisms are tested for a variety of configurations, altering the benchmark and cache configuration. Across the different configurations, the cross sections were improved by 4× to 106×.

2fbd832c-cd42-4bca-b93d-a2f78c34a811,Augmented Reality for Interactive Robot Control,2020,"Robots are widely used to support mission-critical, high-risk and complex operations. Human supervision and remote robot control are often required to operate robots in unpredictable and changing scenarios. Often, robots are controlled remotely by technicians via joystick interfaces which require training and experience to operate. To improve robot usage and practicality, we propose using augmented reality (AR) to create a more intuitive, less training-intensive means of controlling robots than traditional joystick control. AR is a creative platform for developing robot control systems, because AR combines the real world (the environment around the user, the physical robot, etc.) with the digital world (holograms, digital displays, etc.); it can even interpret physical gestures, such as pinching two fingers. In this research, a Microsoft Hololens headset is used to create an AR environment to control a Yaskawa Motoman SIA5D robot. The control process begins with the user placing an interactable holographic robot in 3D space. The user can then select between two control methods: manual control and automatic control. In manual control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot and the physical robot will respond immediately. In automatic control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot to a desired location, view a holographic preview of the motion, and select execute if the motion plan is satisfactory. In this preview mode, the user is able to preview both the motion of the robot and the torques experienced by the joints of the manipulator. This gives the user additional feedback on the planned motion. In this project we succeeded in creating an AR control system that makes controlling a robotic manipulator intuitive and effective. © 2020, Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",10.1007/978-3-030-12243-0_2
758503c9-b236-4f15-90ee-594b8ec3be9f,Visio-acoustic data fusion for structural health monitoring applications,2020,"Structural health monitoring has been an expanding discipline due to its potential to decrease maintenance and downtime costs, detect failure early, extend life spans, and fulfill the increased need of safety and security. Acoustic source identification techniques’ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniques’ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements. Experiments are conducted to show how combining acoustic and video data relaxes the hardware requirements for acoustic source detection and localization applications. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",10.1007/978-3-030-47721-9_5

In this paper, we propose a charge unifiable (QU) control scheme that enables a battery charger to improve power efficiency in a low-profile hardware manner. This scheme features fully soft-switching (vis-&#x00E0;-vis hard switching) and single control scheme (vis-&#x00E0;-vis multiple) for distinct constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes. To the best of authors' knowledge, the proposed QU control scheme is the first to simultaneously offer fully soft-switching, innate CC-and-CV regulation, and seamless CC-to-CV transition. To verify the proposed design, we monolithically realize a low-profile high-efficiency fast battery charger based on this scheme. The prototype embodying a tiny 470-nH output inductor supports a maximum input voltage of 16V, output voltage of 2.2-4.2 V, output current of 0.1-2 A, and peak power efficiency of 96.2&#x0025;. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed charger features at least 2.1x smaller inductor and 7.2&#x0025; higher power efficiency at both the maximum and the minimum output power charging scenarios. Further, this charger is the only design that features &#x2265; 91&#x0025; power efficiency in the whole load range. IEEE",10.1109/TCSI.2020.3007827

By structuring the container of a thermal vapor with narrow emission apertures, the velocity distribution can be modified to create a directed beam of atoms.1 These atomic beams can then interact sequentially with a series of optical fields, or interaction zones, and ultimately allow precision control over the internal state of the atom. This is useful for optical frequency standards and precision spectroscopy2, 3 and may also provide the means to build a simple flying qubit platform.4 Furthermore, atomic beams on a chip can be used as a compact, directed source to load magneto-optical traps (MOTs) while minimally increasing the ambient pressure.5 We apply microfabrication techniques to microscopically structure silicon to deterministically control the ow of Rb between connected cavities. We describe a methodology to measure the experimental parameters that govern the flux of atomic vapors in these microfabricated structures with a goal of creating an equivalent electrical circuit model. This toolkit will provide a simple platform for the creation of atomic beams on a chip with controllable pressure profiles and a thorough understanding of the influence of adsorptive effects and pseudo- ballistic trajectories on the resultant atomic beam. © 2020 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2552585

In regions of high residual weld stresses, this may lead to localized stress-corrosion cracking (SCC). The ability to detect and image SCC at an early stage (long before the cracks are susceptible to propagate through the thickness of the canister wall and leaks of radioactive material may occur) is essential to the performance evaluation and licensing process of the storage systems. In this paper, we explore a number of nondestructive testing techniques to detect and image SCC in austenitic stainless steel. Our attention is focused on a small rectangular sample of 1 × 2 in2 with two cracks of mm-scale sizes. The techniques explored in this paper include nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS) for detection, Linear Elastodynamic Gradient Imaging Technique (LEGIT), ultrasonic C-scan, vibrothermography, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction for imaging. Results obtained from these techniques are compared. Cracks of mm-scale sizes can be detected and imaged with all the techniques explored in this study. © 2019",10.1016/j.ndteint.2019.102180

No fatalities were reported, but the earthquake caused widespread power outages, structural damage to residential buildings, damage to roadways and railways, and ground failures. This paper presents a summary of preliminary findings by the NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) team. Damage was characterized using a combination of on-ground site mapping and aerial reconnaissance with state-of-art geomatics technology and photogrammetry. Recorded peak ground accelerations (PGA) at most stations range between 0.2 g and 0.3 g, with a few sites in the central and southeastern vicinities of Anchorage with PGA greater than 0.5 g. The duration of strong shaking from the M 7.1 event may not have been enough to initiate substantial movements on the majority of the historic landslides from the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake, including the slides at the Turnagain Heights and 4th Avenue. However, liquefaction appeared to have contributed to re-mobilization of the 1964 Potter Hill (Rabbit Creek) landslide. While the majority of the damage observed in Anchorage and surrounding communities appeared to be non-structural, the isolated cases of structural damage seemed to be caused by geotechnical issues, particularly settlement of the foundation and/or slope deformations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784482810.020
58b3233b-78bf-4f5a-a396-3fe872a2b23e,When do workarounds help or hurt patient outcomes? The moderating role of operational failures,2020,"Hospital providers often use workarounds to circumvent processes so that patients can receive care. Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",10.1002/joom.1015

However, preparation of the most complex CFPS reagent – the cell extract – remains time-consuming and labor-intensive because of the relatively slow growth kinetics of the endotoxin-free ClearColiTMBL21(DE3) strain. Here we report a streamlined procedure for preparing E. coli cell extract from ClearColi™ using auto-induction media. In this work, the term auto-induction describes cell culture media which eliminates the need for manual induction of protein expression. Culturing Clearcoli™ cells in autoinduction media significantly reduces the hands-on time required during extract preparation, and the resulting “endotoxin-free” cell extract maintained the same cell-free protein synthesis capability as extract produced with traditional induction as demonstrated by the high-yield expression of crisantaspase, an FDA approved leukemia therapeutic. It is anticipated that this work will lower the barrier for researchers to enter the field and use this technology as the method to produce endotoxin-free E. coli-based extract for CFPS. © 2019",10.1016/j.synbio.2019.11.003

Inlet flow recirculation or backflow in the inducer occurs at low flow conditions and can lead to instabilities and cavitation-induced head breakdown. Backflow of an inducer with a tip clearance (TC) of τ = 0.32% and with no tip clearance (NTC) is examined with a series of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Removing the TC eliminates tip leakage flow; however, backflow is still observed. In fact, the NTC case showed a 37% increase in the length of the upstream backflow penetration. Tip leakage flow does instigate a smaller secondary leading edge tip vortex that is separate from the much larger backflow structure. A comprehensive analysis of these simulations suggests that blade inlet diffusion, not tip leakage flow, is the fundamental mechanism leading to the formation of backflow. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4043770

In order to use external clustering metrics, explicit noise points are usually removed or treated as a single cluster. This modification reduces the relevancy of external metrics as a predictor of performance on unlabeled data, where it is not possible to identify noise points. We propose a modification of standard external metrics to explicitly handle noise points in experimental data. We illustrate the effect of this explicit treatment of noise on clustering evaluation using several examples of common noisy clustering problems as well as a real data set from mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that (external) clustering metrics that explicitly treat noise are more robust than standard (external) clustering metrics in the presence of noise. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00157

Experimental results are presented for quasi-static loading in combination with high-resolution tomographic imaging and statistical analysis (homology of pores or voids and induced cracks). Three distinct mechanisms were observed to control delamination growth in the presence of sharp and blunt voids. Delamination cracks interact with the supporting yarns, especially in combination with air pockets trapped in the resin in the form of long, sharp voids. This resulted in crack growth that coalesces with delamination cracks from neighbouring yarn-voids during increased out-of-plane load–displacement, with almost no presence of intralaminar transverse cracks. This highlights the benefits and drawbacks of the supporting yarn during out-of-plane loading. © The Author(s) 2019.",10.1177/0021998319858024

By altering the separation between adjacent symbols, the minimum required SNR is raised without degradation in the performance of the scheme. This allows the system to adapt to preferable channel conditions for the authorized user, making it harder for eavesdroppers to intercept and decode the transmission, thus making the communication safer. In addition, we show that by overlaying a coset code onto the QAM constellation, a new, stronger security gap metric can be further improved.

Often, ground-truth video of the activity is recorded along with sensor-data recorded during the activity. The data must be synchronized with the recorded video to be useful. In this paper, we present and compare two labeling frameworks that each has a different approach to synchronization. Approach A uses time-stamped visual indicators positioned on the data loggers. The approach results in accurate synchronization between video and data but adds more overhead and is not practical when using multiple sensors, subjects, and cameras simultaneously. Also, synchronization needs to be redone for each recording session. Approach B uses Real-Time Clocks (RTCs) on the devices for synchronization, which is less accurate but has several advantages: multiple subjects can be recorded on various cameras, it becomes easier to collect more data, and synchronization only needs to be done once across multiple recording sessions. Therefore, it is easier to collect more data which increases the probability of capturing an unusual activity.

Static radiative heat exchangers are often simple and reliable systems but typically cannot be adapted to environmental changes. Adaptable radiative heat exchangers can be adjusted in response to variations in the thermal environment or operating conditions and have the potential for increased efficiency and reduced cost. Dynamic control of a radiative heat exchanger is possible through geometric manipulation of a segmented, self-irradiating fin, consisting of rigid panels that are linked by thermal hinges in an accordion arrangement. In this paper, a numerical model is described to predict the temperature profile and efficiency of a radiative heat exchanger, accounting for conduction and self-irradiation. Governing equations are cast in terms of the conduction-radiation interaction parameter, surface emissivity, actuation angle, and the thermal conductance of the hinges linking the panels. Results indicate that a turn-down ratio (largest possible heat rate divided by smallest possible heat rate) of greater than three is possible for realistic panel geometries and materials. Self-irradiation decreases the turn-down ratio, and there is evidence that an optimal number of rigid panels exists for any combination of panel geometry and device temperature. The maximum efficiency occurs when the plates are in the collapsed position, but the heat rate is at a minimum in this configuration. Finally, the properties and geometry of the plates are shown to have a more significant effect on the turn-down ratio than the properties of the thermal hinges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118441

1e12e895-a747-4e89-9058-c73d8afe0ed9,Model Boundary Approximation Method as a Unifying Framework for Balanced Truncation and Singular Perturbation Approximation,2019,"We show that two widely accepted model reduction techniques, balanced truncation (BT) and balanced singular perturbation approximation (BSPA), can be derived as limiting approximations of a carefully constructed parameterization of linear time invariant systems by employing the model boundary approximation method (MBAM) [1]. We also show that MBAM provides a novel way to interpolate between BT and BSPA, by exploring the set of approximations on the boundary of the 'model manifold,' which is associated with the specific choice of model parameterization and initial condition and is embedded in a sample space of measured outputs, between the elements that correspond to the two model reduction techniques. This paper suggests similar types of approximations may be obtainable in topologically similar places (i.e., on certain boundaries) on the associated model manifold of nonlinear systems if analogous parameterizations can be achieved, therefore extending these widely accepted model reduction techniques to nonlinear systems.1 © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAC.2019.2908523
b22581d3-375e-4969-8480-144b29b03e20,Quality assessment of images with multiple distortions based on phase congruency and gradient magnitude,2019,"In image communication systems, images are often contaminated by multiple types of distortions. However, most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods mainly focused on a single type of distortions. In this paper, we proposed a no-reference (NR) IQA method for images with multiple distortions. Image distortions not only destroy the intensity of low-level image features, but also alter their distribution, to both of which the human vision system (HVS) is sensitive. Based on these observations, low-level features are represented by phase congruency (PC) which is consistent with human perception. The distribution of low-level features is extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) in PC domain at multiple scales, which can effectively characterize the impact of multiple distortions on images. Given that PC is contrast invariant while the contrast does affect perceptual image quality of the HVS, image gradient magnitude (GM) is employed as a weighting factor for LBP histogram creation. Finally a support vector regression model is trained to map the gradient-weighted LBP histograms in PC domain at multi-scale to quality scores. Experimental results on two benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high consistency with subjective perception and performs better than other state-of-the-art full-reference (FF) and NR IQA methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.image.2019.08.013

Origami-based engineering provides advantages that are not readily available in traditional engineering design methods. Several processing methods were examined to identify trends and determine the effect of processing of PET sheets on the crease properties of origami mechanisms in PET. Various annealing times, temperatures, and cooling rates were evaluated and data collected for over 1000 samples. It was determined that annealing temperature plays the largest role in crease response. An increase in the crystallinity of a PET sheet while in the folded state likely increases the force response of the crease in PET sheets. An annealing time of at least 60 min at 160 C-180 C with a quick cooling results in a high force response in the crease. The effectiveness of the processing methods was demonstrated in several origami patterns of various complexities. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1361-665X/ab49df

The simulation was used to create records with different inputs and operating conditions and the resulting overall elapsed time for the overall process. The resulting records were used to create a set of predictive artificial neural network models that predicted elapsed time based on the process characteristics. Then, the connection weight approach was used to determine the relative importance of the input variables. The connection weight approach was applied in three different steps: (1) on all input variables to identify predictive and non-predictive inputs, (2) on all predictive inputs, and (3) after removal of a dominating predictive input. This produced a clearer picture of the relative importance of input variables on the outcome variable than applying the connection weight approach once. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/02286203.2018.1558736

Indeed, the way that control is shared between the human operator and the inherent collective robot behaviors determines in large part the success of the human-swarm system. In this paper, we seek to understand how to design human-swarm systems that effectively moderate human influence over a robot swarm. To do this, we implement a simulated swarm system based on honeybees, and study how interacting with this swarm using various methods of moderating human influence impacts the success of the resulting human-swarm system. Our results demonstrate that moderating human influence is essential to achieving effective human-swarm systems, and highlight the need for future work in determining how to better moderate human influence in human-swarm systems. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/SMC.2019.8914592

If the planned path drifts from the human's intent as a result of environment changes, the path needs to be replanned. This paper presents a replanning framework with three elements: (a) the integration of fast online path-planning algorithms that generate trajectories conforming to the given intent; (b) a mathematical model that says when replanning must happen; and (c) an evaluation of events that trigger replanning. An interactive graphical user interface enables a human to accept or reject replanned paths when a trigger happens.

f58f955d-92a5-4cb1-8090-751c74598f26,Proving data race freedom in task parallel programs using a weaker partial order,2019,"Task parallel programming models such as Habanero Java help developers write idiomatic parallel programs and avoid common errors. Data race freedom is a desirable property for task parallel programs but is difficult to prove because every possible execution of the program must be considered. A partial order over events of an observed program execution induces an equivalence class of executions that the program may also produce. The Does-not-Commute (DC) relation is an efficiently computable partial order used for data race detection. As a relatively weak partial order, the DC relation can represent relatively large equivalence classes of program executions. However, some of these executions may be infeasible, thus leading to false data race reports. The contribution of this paper is a mechanized proof that the DC relation is actually sound for commonly used task parallel programming models. Sound means that the first data race identified by the DC relation is guaranteed to be a real data race. A prototype analysis in the Java Pathfinder model checker shows that the DC relation can significantly reduce the number of explored states required to prove data race freedom in Habanero Java programs. In this application, the search for data race using the DC relation is both sound and complete. © 2019 FMCAD Inc.",10.23919/FMCAD.2019.8894270

Industry professionals should focus on practices that can improve project team selection, team building, and identifying challenges to the team and project, hence improving alignment. This paper provides a summary of key findings of a national study of transportation projects, identifying current practices of industry professionals for the selection and alignment of project teams for transportation projects. Current team selection practices, the most beneficial team alignment practices, and the greatest challenges to team alignment are identified in the study. These practices are also analyzed and reported by project delivery method, and the results presented in this paper add to the body of knowledge by identifying current alignment practices, successful practices, and challenges specific to each delivery method. Among the findings are that overall project teams are selected primarily based on project experience and ability to meet schedule, regardless of the project delivery method chosen. Successful teams with good alignment were found to be characterized by having established expectations, team trust, honesty within the team, shared values, and good communication. No notable differences were found among delivery methods, demonstrating that the principles of team alignment are not dependent on the project delivery method. Challenges that cause adversarial relationships in the team include issues of constructability, schedule availability, and project complexity. The study also identified transportation-specific alignment challenges such as public involvement. The greatest challenges specific to each delivery method include team coordination for construction manager at risk (CMAR) projects, constructability procedures for design-bid-build projects, and environmental impacts for design-build projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001704

The sensing matrix comprises samples of shaped offset QPSK-TG (a continuous phase modulation) based on the pilot bit sequence currently defined in the aeronautical telemetry standard. Representative algorithms from the three broad classes of sparse estimators were examined side by side using computer simulations to estimate the postequalizer bit error rate (BER). Ideal and nonideal frequency offset synchronization were assumed in the simulations. The results show that the performance of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithms seemed to be better suited to this application in the sense that no additional steps were required and the postequalizer BER of the best MP algorithm was slightly better than that of the other sparse estimation techniques. In the case of both ideal and nonideal frequency offset synchronization, the postequalizer BER achieved by the generalized orthogonal MP algorithm was approximately 1.5 dB better than that obtained using the nonsparse-constrained maximum likelihood channel estimate. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",10.1109/TAES.2018.2890350

As a result, 38 mid-rise structures collapsed and several hundred more were damaged. This paper reports the observations related to building performance, damage patterns, and foundation performance made by the two UNAM-GEER engineering reconnaissance teams sent to investigate the geotechnical aspects of the earthquake. The methodology used to perform building damage mapping following the 2017 event is described. Comparisons are made between the observed building damage patterns following the September 19th, 1985 and the 2017 earthquake, and the distinct differences in the damage pattern distribution between the two earthquakes are summarized. Overall, building and foundation performance were observed to be quite good during the 2017 event, especially when compared to the 1985 event. Structures that were observed to be heavily damaged or collapsed were all built prior to 1985, and incorporated poor structural design and/or construction which resonated with the soil column on which they were constructed, and/or were built upon very soft soils that contributed to significant foundation deformations. Detailed building damage pattern maps of specific neighborhoods that were investigated are provided, and lessons learned from this event are summarized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.105708
543eecc0-e39f-41ad-82de-6c3fb6c6a2b4,Using non-destructive testing to predict bending modulus of carbon infiltrated-carbon nanotubes,2019,"Carbon infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNT) are an important emerging material in several micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) because of their unique mechanical and chemical properties. While CI-CNTs are only roughly conductive they work well in micro springs, levers, and meshes. However, fabrication of CI-CNTs can result in large mechanical property variation, and methods to characterize properties usually involve destructive testing. Destructive testing also assumes the tested specimens are representative of the entire batch which is not always true in the case of CI-CNT production. Finding a non-destructive way to test for stiffness of this material reduces the number of parts that have to be made and increases confidence in the integrity of device being used. It also simplifies testing of complex parts. The stiffness of CI-CNT beams is related to the molecular structure of the carbon material infiltrated between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), how it interacts with the CNTs, and how much of it there is. The amount of material can be approximated with the density of the beam, and both the type of material and its interaction with the CNTs can be approximated through analysis of the Raman spectra taken at the surface. A combination of these two observations can be related to the effective material stiffness. The relationship can be fitted with a power function, with a variance of 1.41 GPa, which is about 11% of the maximum stiffness of the samples tested. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1361-6439/ab3fd2

The printed packaging cylinder delineates printed potting for electronics packaging. An nScrypt direct write (DW) system was the primary manufacturing system but a developing technology - coined large area projection sintering (LAPS) - manufactured a subset of samples for comparison. The tests follow Military Standard (MIL STD) 883 K and include resiliency evaluation for die shear strength, temperature cycling, thermal shock, and high G loading by mechanical shock. Results indicate DW Master Bond epoxy devices show resilience to extreme temperatures, thermal shock, and mechanical shocks while also surpassing the die shear strength failure criteria specified by the MIL STD. LAPS sintered Nylon devices also show mechanical resilience to thermal shock and surpass the die shear strength failure criteria. However, there were some open circuits, increases in resistance, and delamination when LAPS Nylon devices were subjected to extreme temperatures and 20 000 G shock loading normal to the substrate. The thermal effects are likely due to the thermal expansion mismatch between Nylon and the conductive paste while the mechanical shock effects may be attributed to the geometry differences of the LAPS Nylon printed packaging. Further studies are required to understand these failure modes in some of the LAPS Nylon samples and refine the process to address them. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/2058-8585/ab38e9

An integral analysis of the transport equations resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations was solved numerically. Impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces greatly reduces the heat transfer that occurs relative to a smooth surface due to gas trapped in cavities on the surface. This results in an apparent slip velocity and temperature jump at the surface. Local and average Nusselt numbers are presented as a function of radial position (0 to 45 jet radii), jet Reynolds number (3×103 to 1.5×104), liquid Prandtl number (2 to 11), normalized slip length (0 to 0.2), and normalized temperature jump length (0 to 0.2). All results are compared to classical (no-slip, no temperature jump) behavior on a smooth surface. Although local Nusselt numbers for the isoflux scenario are greater than the corresponding isothermal case, the difference in Nusselt number between these two heating conditions becomes negligible as the temperature jump length increases to quantities realizable on superhydrophobic surfaces. These results may be utilized to explore heat transfer degradation in applications where smooth surfaces are replaced by superhydrophobic surfaces to avoid fouling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.05.113

Any perceptible distortion level must be greater than the JND. Based on this observation, a local binary pattern (LBP) is developed for image quality assessment. First, the JND map of the image is computed. The spatial and relative intensity relationships among pixels in a local neighborhood are employed to generate the proposed LBP based on the JND map. Then, image contrast is used as a weighting factor for the LBP histogram generation to characterize the structural and contrast information of the image. Finally, the contrast and structure changes due to image distortion are measured by calculating the similarity between contrast-weighted histograms of the reference and distorted images. Support vector regression is employed to pool the similarity to predict the quality. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed LBP can effectively and accurately measure image quality, which is consistent with the HVS.

Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70.

Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively. In conclusion, the CDSSs designed based on cost-sensitive objective functions as well as salient comorbidity-related features achieve satisfactory predictive performance for predicting ED incidences. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/JBHI.2018.2877595
049b508c-addb-4613-8c9a-c5b0a319969b,Structure descriptor based on just noticeable difference for texture image classification,2019,"Local binary pattern (LBP) and its derivates have been widely used in texture classification. However, LBP-based methods are sensitive to noise, and some structure information represented by non-uniform patterns is lost due to the combination of these patterns. In this paper, a new local structure descriptor based on just noticeable difference (JND) for texture classification is proposed by exploring the spatial and relative intensity correlations among local neighborhood pixels. First, a JND map of the image is computed, and then we attempt to model the correlations among local neighborhood pixels by comparing the absolute differences in intensity between the central pixel and its neighbors with the corresponding JND threshold. A new visual pattern (JNDVP) is designed using modeled correlations to describe image structure. Next, considering that image contrast makes important contributions to structure description, contrast is employed as a weighting factor for JNDVP histogram creation to represent structural and contrast information in a single representation. Finally, the nearest neighborhood classifier is employed for texture classification. Results on two texture image databases demonstrate that the proposed structure descriptor is rotation invariant and more robust to noise than LBP. Moreover, texture classification based on JNDVP outperforms LBP-based methods. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",10.1364/AO.58.006504

Although most existing laminar micromixers attempted to reduce mixing time, our work focused on developing a system that can generate high-resolution images under a more stable flow, which results in more accurate kinetic analysis. Specifically, we developed a simple three-dimensional (3D) laminar micromixer, which distributes the sample stream to a 3D profile to address flow-instability issues caused by Dean vortices in a two-dimensional mixer. In the 3D mixer, the sample stream was successfully focused to a one-pixel width at the resolution of ˜200 nm/pixel, which approached the resolving power of an optical microscope and represented the highest imaging resolution ever achieved using a 3D mixer. Furthermore, we used the device to investigate the early folding kinetics of G-quadruplex under various sodium cation concentrations. Interestingly, a lag phase was found before the exponential phase during the folding process. Moreover, we obtained the G-quadruplex's observed kinetics of (1.51 ± 0.02) ×104 s−1, (1.68 ± 0.04) ×104 s−1 and (2.01 ± 0.02) ×104 s−1 at 50-, 100- and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.snb.2019.05.026

For all aluminas, heat treatment results in decreased surface area and increased pore diameter. Starting at 700 °C, metastable to stable phase transformation occurs, causing a substantial change in the pore structure of all aluminas. By 1100 (PA), 1200 (15 SDA) and 1200 °C (27 SDA), the transition to α-Al2O3 was complete, respectively. No α-Al2O3 is observed for 5 wt % silica doped alumina (5SDA) under thermal calcination. Calcination in steam and air, instead of in air only, results in enlarged pore size and depressed temperature of alpha phase transformation for all aluminas. Results show that the silica dopant modifies the pores of the alumina, stabilizes the oxygen lattice of γ-Al2O3, and retards α-Al2O3 formation. This study of the thermal and hydrothermal stability not only suggests the applicability of 5SDA for catalytic reactions occurring at high temperature in the presence of steam, but also contributes to a better understanding of the structural features responsible for the improved thermal stability of these aluminas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.04.005

Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF. (6) Similarly, adding viscoelasticity to the wrong DOF can increase tremor. Based solely on the musculoskeletal system, these principles indicate that tremor treatments targeting muscles should focus first on the distal muscles, and devices targeting DOF should focus first on the distal DOF. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4043442

Security is measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence and resolvability techniques along with a limited number of practical assumptions regarding the eavesdropper's decoder. The results specify a general coding recipe for obtaining both secure and reliable communications over the Gaussian wiretap channel, and one specific set of concatenated codes is presented as a test case for the sake of providing simulation-based evaluation of security and reliability over the network. It is shown that there exists a threshold in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a Gaussian channel, such that receivers experiencing SNR below the threshold have no practical hope of receiving information about the message when the three-stage coding technique is applied. Results further indicate that the two innermost encoding stages successfully approximate a binary symmetric channel, allowing the outermost encoding stage (e.g., a wiretap code) to focus solely on secrecy coding over this approximated channel. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TIFS.2019.2892010

Compared with conventional friction stir welding tools, a friction stir scribe tool can reduce heat input significantly limiting the IMC layer thickness (~100–750 nm). Friction stir scribe joined lap joints fractured either through the welded interface or within the base aluminum alloy on the loading side, depending on IMC layer thickness during tensile lap shear testing.

Using this method, baseline fabric characterization data was obtained for samples comprised of varying layers of 467 g/m 2 Kevlar K29 fabric impacted with 8.24 g steel ball projectile and backed with NATO standard 20% clear ballistics gelatin. For these tests, deformation depths were seen to increase with increasing impact energy and decreasing total areal density. A limited study of the various test parameters was performed by testing one additional fabric, projectile, and ballistics gelatin. From these comparisons, it was observed that 122 g/m 2 Kevlar KM2+ fabric performs better per weight than 467 g/m 2 Kevlar K29 fabric in terms of BFD, 9 mm FMJ projectiles produce deeper BFDs than 12.7 mm steel ball projectiles, and backing a sample with FBI standard 10% ballistics gel increases the BFD considerably over NATO standard 20% ballistics gel. © 2019",10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.04.025

Further, by collecting one observation every 12 minutes, rather than a subgroup of five every hour, the time-weighted charts of individual values result in a shorter ATS (average time to signal) than would be possible using Shewhart charts of subgrouped data. This article explores a similar strategy of monitoring process variability using time-weighted control charts and individual observations. The average time to signal a change in variability using these charts is studied when there are targets or known values for the in-control process mean and standard deviation. The results show that the ATS of both the Cusum and EWMA are substantially shorter than the ATS for the standard R charts or the more efficient S2 chart using subgroups of 5. The article also describes how the control limits for the EWMA chart to monitor process variability should be modified if the in-control process mean and standard deviations are unknown and must be estimated from a Phase I study. Computer functions that are available in R packages for creating Cusum-EWMA charts and computing their ARL (average run length) are demonstrated in this study and are included in the appendix. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/08982112.2018.1557205

This tool is particularly valuable for designers from the developed world working on products for customers in developing communities as differences in culture, language, and life experience make the designer’s intuition less reliable in these communities. This paper reports the use of design ethnography under a variety of conditions in the developing world. The data analyzed here come from field studies completed in four different developing communities on four different continents. Researchers had varying degrees of cultural familiarity, language fluency, and community partner participation in each location. Other factors were also included in the study such as the effects of gender and age of the respondents, the ethnographic activity used, and others. Some of the results are intuitive and some are surprising, but all are quantified through rigorous statistical analysis. The results of this study can help design teams of all types including NGOs, student teams, industrial teams, and any other team with an interest in product design in developing communities.

In design, engineers generally neglect any beneficial effects of the block-out concrete. The objective of this study is to experimentally quantify the effect of block-out concrete on the lower-bound flexural strength and stiffness of block-out connections at the base of steel moment frames. Eight specimens were tested with varying column shape, block-out depth, and baseplate/anchor rod designs. The block-out concrete increased the connection flexural strengths by 69%-91% for block-out depths that were 1.2-1.5 times the column depth. A strength model proposed in previous work was found to reasonably predict the flexural strength, accounting for the effects of block-out concrete. With regard to stiffness, specimens with block-out concrete depths at least 1.15 times the column depth could be accurately modeled as fixed at the top-of-footing elevation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002333

A similarity solution is utilized to yield a model for the transient heat flux at the droplet-wall interface, where convection inside the droplet is accounted for.

Extended PWHT at 607 °C caused significant carbon migration and microstructural change across the fusion boundary. Following PWHT at 607 °C for 20 hours, the carbon-enriched zone exhibited little to no reduction in hardness although 20 pct hardness reduction occurred in the remainder of the first butter layer. This is because tempering of the martensite in the carbon-enriched zone was entirely offset by the formation of a high density of chromium carbides. In contrast, following PWHT at 607 °C for 20 hours the average hardness of the carbon-depleted zone decreased from 241 HV to 169 HV due to the elimination of martensite, ferrite grain coarsening and carbon depletion. In addition, the extended PWHT significantly enhanced the mismatch in mechanical properties between the carbon-enriched zone (351 HV) and the adjacent carbon-depleted zone (169 HV). The formation of chromium carbides (less than 200 nm in size) in the carbon-enriched zone reduced the carbon concentration in the matrix, generating a continued driving force for carbon migration from A508 steel to the weld metal during PWHT. © 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",10.1007/s11661-019-05223-y

The results confirm the ability to predict the slip system of a transmitted dislocation using common geometric criteria.

In industrial inspection, it is important to collect the most relevant data to keep processing demands, both human and computational, to a minimum. This study investigates the viability of automated targeted multi-scale image acquisition for Structure from Motion (SfM)-based infrastructure modeling. A traditional view-planning approach for SfM is extended to a multi-scale approach, planning for targeted regions of high, medium, and low priority. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can traverse the entire aerial space and facilitates collection of an optimized set of views, both close to and far away from areas of interest. The test case for field validation is the Tibble Fork Dam in Utah. Using the targeted multi-scale flight planning, a UAV automatically flies a tiered inspection using less than 25% of the number of photos needed to model the entire dam at high-priority level. This results in approximately 75% reduced flight time and model processing load, while still maintaining high model accuracy where needed. Models display stepped improvement in visual clarity and SfM reconstruction integrity by priority level, with the higher priority regions more accurately modeling smaller and finer features. A resolution map of the final tiered model is included. While this study focuses on multi-scale view planning for optical sensors, the methods potentially extend to other remote sensors, such as aerial LiDAR. © 2019 by the authors.

Gyrostabilization is a potential option, but we do not currently know how to optimize gyrostabilization for tremor suppression. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation of how gyrostabilizer parameters affect tremor suppression in a single degree of freedom (DOF). A simple model with a single DOF at the wrist and a gyroscope mounted on the back of the hand was used to focus on the most basic effects. We simulated the frequency response of the system (hand + gyroscope) to a tremorogenic input torque at the wrist. Varying system parameters one at a time, we determined the effect of individual parameters on the system's frequency response. To minimize the bandwidth without adding significant inertia, the inertia and spin speed of the flywheel should be as high as design constraints allow, whereas the distance from the wrist joint axis to the gyroscope and the precession stiffness and damping should be kept as low as possible. The results demonstrate the potential of gyroscopic tremor suppression and can serve as foundation for further investigations of gyroscopic tremor suppression in the upper limb. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/S0219519419500246

The network topology, training, and testing results are presented as well as filter development and results.

Estimates of the range rate and angular rate to the target are used to improve the error in the range and bearing. For moving targets, their velocity is also estimated and used in the control law. Theoretical proofs using Lyapunov theory for stationary targets and feedback linearization for moving targets are provided.

The proposed LQR formulation is based in Lie theory and linearized at each time step according to the multirotor's current state.

RapidScat UHR wind estimation provides finer resolution ocean wind vector fields than conventional 12.5-km level 2B (L2B) wind products at a cost of higher noise. In addition, this paper applies direction interval retrieval techniques and develops other wind processing improvements to enhance the performance of RapidScat UHR wind estimation.

e3b03ee8-e170-4a8b-b81f-58dfd268e8af,Scatterometer Backscatter Imaging Using Backus-Gilbert Inversion,2019,"Wind scatterometer measurements are collected over an irregular grid, and processing is required to generate backscatter images on an Earth-centered grid. The most common algorithms used for this are ""drop in the bucket"" (DIB) and variations of the scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) algorithm. These algorithms are also used for radiometer brightness temperature imaging. The Backus-Gilbert (BG) algorithm has been used for radiometer imaging but has not been applied to scatterometer backscatter imaging. In this paper, the application of BG to scatterometer backscatter imaging is explored and its performance is compared to DIB and SIR. Like SIR, optimally tuned BG is capable of producing higher resolution images than DIB, though its noise performance is slightly inferior to SIR's. While BG and SIR produce similar results for radiometer data, the higher relative noise level of scatterometer data increases the differences between the SIR and BG algorithm performance, and limits the performance of BG relative to SIR in scatterometer imaging. Comparison of the SIR and BG algorithms in scatterometer imaging offers important insights into the inversion/reconstruction problem. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/TGRS.2018.2882136

We surveyed 4,275 students, faculty, and staff at Brigham Young University to measure user sentiment about Duo 2FA one year after the university adopted it. The results were mixed. A majority of the participants felt more secure using Duo and felt it was easy to use. About half of all participants reported at least one instance of being locked out of their university account because of an inability to authenticate with Duo. We found that students and faculty generally had more negative perceptions of Duo than staff. The survey responses reveal some pain points for Duo users. In response, we offer recommendations that reduce the frequency of 2FA for users. We also suggest UI changes that draw more attention to 2FA methods that do not require WiFi, the 'Remember Me' setting, and the help utility. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/EuroSPW.2019.00020

Seven gestures were chosen and mapped to specific behaviors that a fixed wing unmanned air vehicle could accomplish. These behaviors specified various searching, following, and tracking patterns that could be used in a dynamic environment. The system was trained to recognize the seven gestures and then tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The system was able to identify all gestures with an overall accuracy of 90% and with five of the seven gestures being accurately identified at least 94% of the time. Each of the behaviors associated with the gestures was tested in simulation and the ability to dynamically switch between behaviors was proven. The results show that the system can be used as a natural interface to assist an operator in directing an unmanned air vehicle's behaviors. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8797743

We explore how students' audience awareness is facilitated by the case method, which presents students with a professional communication task within a workplace scenario. Situating the case: Case-method research suggests including a detailed audience and situation, multiple genres, and multimedia. Few studies have explored how case materials facilitate students' audience awareness. About the case: A 12-week case that was consistent with case-method research asked students to respond to an engineering firm's internal problem with a proposal and report. How the case was studied: Students from two sections of a genre-based course completed reflections about their audience awareness after the proposal and report. We qualitatively analyzed 51 reflections. Results/discussion: Students stated they could understand the facts about their primary audience but couldn't identify secondary and tertiary audiences. Students stated they could identify audience needs, but they disagreed about the amount of detail to understand those needs. Also, students stated they could respond to the audience using appropriate evidence and writing style. Conclusions: When using the case method, instructors should know that students may need varying levels of detail to interpret their audience's needs. Also, including data and conflicting needs gives students opportunities to make strategic decisions about content. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TPC.2019.2893464
7db6fca9-ae6a-46ec-b9ff-2fbce17453a1,Highly accurate acoustic scattering: Isogeometric Analysis coupled with local high order Farfield Expansion ABC,2019,"This work is concerned with a unique combination of high order local absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) with a general curvilinear Finite Element Method (FEM) and its implementation in Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for time-harmonic acoustic waves. The ABC employed were recently devised by Villamizar et al. (2017). They are derived from exact Farfield Expansions representations of the outgoing waves in the exterior of the regions enclosed by the artificial boundary. As a consequence, the error due to the ABC on the artificial boundary can be reduced conveniently such that the dominant error comes from the volume discretization method used in the interior of the computational domain. Reciprocally, the error in the interior can be made as small as the error at the artificial boundary by appropriate implementation of p- and h-refinement. We apply this novel method to cylindrical, spherical and arbitrary shape scatterers including a prototype submarine. Our numerical results exhibit spectral-like approximation and high order convergence rate. Additionally, they show that the proposed method can reduce both the pollution and artificial boundary errors to negligible levels even in very low- and high-frequency regimes with rather coarse discretization densities in the IGA. As a result, we have developed a highly accurate computational platform to numerically solve time-harmonic acoustic wave scattering in two- and three-dimensions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.cma.2019.03.005

Using data from a large campus district energy system, equipped with centralized chilled water plants and a thermal energy storage tank, a novel technique is proposed to optimize this system in real-time, formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. This method, titled Quadratic Programming Hybrid with Augmented Constraints, is sufficiently fast to be computed in real-time for a district chiller system. This method is compared to both Branch and Bound and a simple logical decision algorithm in both speed and optimality. The proposed method for solving this mixed-integer quadratic programming problem proves very successful at achieving a near-optimal solution when compared to a standard Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm. Although suboptimal, the proposed algorithm takes 99.96–99.99% less computational time than the standard BnB and computes an answer to within 29.9% of the BnB objective function. When compared to a simple logical decision algorithm, which represents an operator manually controlling the plant, the proposed method is estimated to yield 8.10–33.7% in savings on chiller energy costs. The Quadratic Programming Hybrid with Augmented Constraints algorithm shows potential for use in a real-time optimization application to exploit variable electricity pricing and significantly reduce the costs of running a chiller plant with thermal energy storage. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11081-018-09419-w

The NVPSC model is an extension of a stochastic model for twin nucleation developed by Niezgoda et al. and a dislocation density based hardening law model developed by Knezevic et al. Beyond the baseline combined framework, the new model tracks sets of neighboring grains and allows twin transmission between them under certain conditions. The influence of grain boundary (GB) character is included in the stochastic models of twin nucleation and transmission. The starting texture from a rolled magnesium alloy AZ31B sheet was obtained using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for initial input into the NVPSC. The sample was further deformed by uniaxial compression to encourage twin formation and the corresponding texture information was collected using EBSD. The accuracy of simulated twin activity was determined by comparing it with the twin activity seen in the deformed sample. The total number of predicted twins and the number of transmission twins is found to agree favorably with those observed via the EBSD scans. This validation demonstrates the significance of incorporating twin transmission as a twin formation mode in predictive models for this material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.ijplas.2018.03.012

Thus, during the Mw 8.1 09/19/1985﻿ subduction fault earthquake, and its strong aftershock Mw 7.5 09/21/1985, extensive damage was observed in the area, along with the loss of thousands of lives, despite these events had an epicentral distance of around 430 km from Mexico City. The observed damage was mostly due to site affects originated by the high plastiCity clay deposits found in the basin, which lead to large amplifications, and duration elongation of the ground motions coming from the epicenter. In addition, a frequency content modification occurs, which in turn, leads to a double resonance effect between the incoming ground motions, soil deposits, and the damaged buildings. Exactly 32 years after this devastating event, the Mw 7.1 09/19/2017 normal fault earthquake, reminded us of the importance of accounting for site effects, and most importantly the need to carry out a proper characterization of basin geometry, soil profile configuration, hydraulic conditions, and maintenance-structure periodic assessments of the building stock in Mexico City. This is required to reduce uncertainties of seismic vulnerability studies for extreme-event seismic hazard scenarios. In this paper, the role of site response and seismic soil-structure interaction as key factors responsible of the observed damage in the City is revisited, through series of 3D finite difference models of typical structure-foundation-soil typologies found at the areas where most of the damage was observed, highlighting its clear impact in the final damage distribution observed around the City. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.02.028
7665907d-0fa3-4f09-b46c-70932ceba535,Thermal and Vapor Smoothing of Thermoplastic for Reduced Surface Roughness of Additive Manufactured RF Electronics,2019,"Additive manufacturing (AM) of electronics provides a route for creating customized systems with novel geometries that are not feasible with traditional methods. Standard AM processes such as extrusion can produce substrates on which electrical traces can be deposited. However, the surface roughness of plastic extrusion reduces the effective electrical conductivity and can introduce anisotropy, especially in radio frequency (RF) devices. The roughness can be reduced using vapor smoothing (VS), but solvent absorption changes the surface composition slightly, can be environmentally hazardous, and is not feasible with all thermoplastics. A new method introduced here - coined thermal smoothing (TS) - utilizes a heat source to locally reflow the material, thus minimizing the roughness of the undulating surfaces without the drawbacks of VS. This research work compares the surface roughness impacts of both smoothing processes with profilometry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Both smoothing processes significantly reduce the surface roughness of extruded components by 80% and 90% for TS and VS, respectively. This paper also examines the influence of surface smoothing on high-frequency conductivity of microdispensed conductors (CB028 paste) deposited on the substrates. The measured loss on coplanar waveguides shows an improvement of up to 40% at 7 GHz. © 2011-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2910791

Design: Fifty-three participants with radiographic KOA (47% female, 62.3 ± 7.1 years, BMI = 28.5 ± 3.9 kg/m 2 ) were enrolled in 10 sessions of lower extremity strengthening over a 28-day period. Maximum isometric quadriceps strength and walking gait biomechanics were collected on the involved limb at baseline and 4-weeks following the strengthening intervention. Responders were classified as individuals who increased quadriceps strength greater than the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the minimal detectable change (MDC) in quadriceps strength (29 Nm) determined in a previous study. 2 × 2 functional analyses of variance were used to evaluate the effects of group (responders and non-responders) and time (baseline and 4-weeks) on time-normalized waveforms for knee flexion angle (KFA), vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), and internal knee extension moment (KEM). Results: A significant group x time interaction for KFA demonstrated greater KFA in the first half of stance at baseline and greater knee extension in the second half of stance at 4-weeks in responders compared to non-responders. There was no significant group x time interaction for vGRF or internal KEM. Conclusions: Quadriceps strengthening may be used to stimulate small changes in KFA in individuals with KOA. © 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International",10.1016/j.joca.2018.12.026

Computer vision technology is being viewed as an effective tool for automatic food recognition for monitoring nutrition intake. Of the many food recognition algorithms in the literature, Bag-of-Features model is a proven approach that has shown impressive recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a small and efficient convolutional neural network architecture for Chinese food recognition, which is more applicable for resources limited platforms. Our network architecture is designed to model and perform a pipeline of processing similar to the Bag-of-Features approach. The main advantage of the proposed architecture, like other convolutional neural networks, is its ability to unifiedly optimize the entire network through back propagation, which is critical to recognition accuracy. We further compare and correlate our architecture with the traditional Bag-of-Features model in an attempt to investigate the similarities between them and identify factors that influence the recognition accuracy. The proposed architecture with a 5-layer deep convolutional neural network achieves the top-1 accuracy of 97.12% and the top-5 accuracy of 99.86% on a newly created Chinese food image dataset that is composed of 8734 images of 25 food categories.

In this paper, the transfer matrix method is combined with D'Alembert's principle to develop a two-port dynamic stiffness model for analyzing the kinetostatics and dynamics of complex compliant mechanisms with serial-parallel configurations. In detail, two kinds of improved transfer matrices for parallel sub-chains are derived in a unified form by summarizing the common serial-parallel substructures in compliant mechanisms. Then, a two-port dynamic stiffness model describing the frequency-dependent input and output force-displacement relationship of compliant mechanisms is established. Based on the two-port dynamic stiffness model, procedures for solving the static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms are presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated by calculating the displacement amplification ratio, input/output stiffness, natural frequencies and forced dynamic response of two typical precision flexure manipulators. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in its capability to describe the simultaneous kinetostatics and dynamics for a large class of serial-parallel configurations with very few degrees of freedom (DOFs), differing from the previous Lagrange-based dynamic modeling methods in the context of compliant mechanisms and should be of interest to designers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.precisioneng.2019.04.004

ed0ceda7-40e8-42c4-b244-009f8ea9df43,The use of a binary chelate formulation: Could gadolinium based linear contrast agents be rescued by the addition of zinc selective chelates?,2019,"Tissue and bone retention of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) has become a clinical concern because of the potential short and long term toxic effects of free gadolinium. This is a critical problem for most open-chain agents that more readily transmetallate in vivo, in comparison to macrocyclic compounds. Gadolinium diethylene tri-aminepentaacetic acid bis-glucosamide (Gd-DTPA-BIGA) is an experimental, open-chain contrast agent which has a significantly increased relaxivity coefficient in comparison to other GBCAs. This results in greater signal intensity and improved contrast enhancement. These superior imaging qualities initiated a search for a solution to the transmetallation of this agent. Plasma zinc is a well-known GBCA transmettalation agent. Since the base chelate of Gadodiamide (Gd-DPTA-Bis-Methylamide or Omniscan), DTPA-Bis-Methylamide (DTPA-BMA), readily transmettalates with and binds serum zinc, we hypothesized that a plasma “zinc sink,” may significantly reduce transmetallation of linear agents. 5% DTPA-BMA was added to a formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA, which was tested against the original formulation of Gd-DTPA-BIGA with 0.2% of the base chelate DTPA-BIGA. These formulations, including gadodiamide, were labeled with 153 GdCl 3 followed by infusion into cohorts of Sprague Dawley rats which were sacrificed at 1, 30 and 60 days. Internal organs were harvested, along with blood, skin and femur, and analyzed for residual gadolinium. A subset of tissues were also interrogated with ICP-MS. Labeled Gadodiamide and saline where used as controls. Conclusion: The addition of 5% DTPA-BMA, as a zinc binding agent, reduced the transmetallation of the linear agent Gd-DTPA-BIGA, in comparison to its original formulation supplemented with 0.2% BIGA. This result indicates that supplementing linear GBCAs with ancillary chelates may hold promise for reducing, or eliminating the biological archiving of gadolinium in tissues. In addition, this paper provides valuable animal data on the long term retention of gadolinium from linear based contrast agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.mri.2019.01.001

However, this method suffered from false negatives due to the subjective nature of the analysis. Here, we provide an informatics analysis of the data from this study, contrasting the results of traditional statistical methods and less traditional mathematical techniques. First, three well-known multivariate statistical tools: cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares (PLS) are applied to develop calibrations and/or group electropherograms of undoped (0%) and doped (5% and 10%) blood samples. (These doping levels were chosen due to the low physiological effect of doping below 5%, with 10% corresponding to the approximate ‘gain' derived from the transfusion of a single unit of blood into an adult.) Different preprocessing and variable selection methods were considered. Due to variation in the electropherograms and the limited sample size, these methods were inadequate. We next considered four less commonly used mathematical/informatics tools: pattern recognition entropy (PRE), the Euclidean distance between vectors, a peak fitting/integration method, and the second moment (SM). Each of these techniques showed some ability to differentiate between the 0, 5, and 10% doped samples. We then evaluated the prediction capabilities of inverse least squares (ILS) models based on these summary statistics. An ILS calibration based on PRE, the Euclidean distance, and peak fitting/integration proved more successful than the PLS model at predicting levels of blood doping from the corresponding electropherograms; the ILS model distinguished between doped (5% and 10%) and undoped (0%) blood. This methodology may be applicable to other challenging informatics problems like determining risk factors for genetically linked diseases, robust pattern finding in peak-like data such as ChIP-seq, or other genomic sequencing for understanding the 3D genome. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",10.1039/c9ay00192a

As techniques for thick, rigid origami-based engineering designs are being developed, origami is becoming increasingly more attractive as inspiration for complex systems. This paper proposes a process for designing origami-based conceal-and-reveal systems, which can be generalized to design similar thick, rigid origami-based systems. The process is demonstrated through the development of three conceal-and-reveal systems that present a luxury product to the consumer. The three designs also confirm that multiple origami crease patterns can be used to initiate viable approaches to achieving conceal-and-reveal motion. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4042427

We present both quantitative and qualitative results from 28 pairs of novices as they use Private WebMail (Pwm), Tutanota, and Virtru and 10 pairs of novices as they use Mailvelope. Participants report being more at ease with this type of study and better able to cope with mistakes since both participants are “on the same page.” We find that users prefer integrated solutions over depot-based solutions and that tutorials are important in helping first-time users.

As usage becomes more widespread, airspace will become increasingly crowded. These high-density unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) situations will pose many unique challenges, including in conflict resolution. Using agent-based models, conflict resolution and the well-clear and action-distance concepts for small multirotor UAVs in dense environments were explored. Specifically, the safety and efficiency of several collision-avoidance mechanisms under different possible densities, accelerations, and action distances were investigated. The results suggest that selecting appropriate action distances and collision-avoidance mechanisms will be vital to maintaining safety and efficiency. Interestingly, excessive action distances quickly degrade performance: using a simple method under high-density conditions (1 UAV∕km2), well-clear distances above approximately 750 m have extremely low efficiency (∼1% as many deliveries accomplished in 5000 simulation hours compared to lower distances). More advanced algorithms also suffer from low efficiency at higher (∼1 km) response distances. Different definitions for near-midair collisions and their effects on system safety and well-clear distance are discussed. © 2018 by John Salmon.

The bit error rate (BER) performance and computational complexity of the approximate MLSE equalizer operating over three example channels, motivated by multipath propagation in aeronautical telemetry and with increasing selectivity, are presented. The BER performance was evaluated using computer simulations and shown to be approximately 5-8 dB better than the best frequency-domain minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizers published in the open literature.

The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of Losartan to inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathway of TGF-β1 observed during osteoarthritic progression in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and knee joint using a genetic mouse model. Methods: A murine OA model displaying the heterozygous chondrodysplasia gene (cho/+), a col11a1 mutation, was used to test this hypothesis. Following a 7-month treatment period with Losartan, the synovial joints were analyzed for histopathological improvement comparing two experimental groups. Tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, processed to paraffin section, and stained with Safranin O and Fast Green to visualize proteoglycans and collagen proteins in cartilage. Using the Modified Mankin scoring system, the degree of staining and OA progression were evaluated. Results: Results show heterozygous animals receiving Losartan having diminished degeneration of TMJ condylar and knee joint articular cartilage. This was confirmed in the TMJ and knee by a statistically significant decrease in the Mankin histopathology score. Decreased expression of HtrA1, a key regulator to the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, was demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo, via Losartan inhibition. Conclusion: Using a genetic mouse model of OA, this study demonstrated the utility of Losartan to improve treatment of human OA in the TMJ and knee joint through inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling cascade. We further demonstrated inhibition of HtrA1, the lowering of Mankin scores to wild type control levels, and the limiting of OA progressive damage with treatment of Losartan. © 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International",10.1016/j.joca.2018.12.016

This nondestructive test method was developed on the assumption of instantaneous surface heating, but recent work has shown that relatively long pulses can be used to accurately determine defect depth in polymers. This paper examines the impact of varying input pulse length on the accuracy of defect depth quantification as a function of the material properties. Simulations using both thermoplastics and metals show that measurement error is dependent on a nondimensionalized pulse length. The simulation results agree with experimental results for three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) components. Analysis and experiments show that defects can be accurately detected with minor modification to the standard methods as long as the pulse ends before the characteristic defect signal is detected. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4042785

When conventional fusion welding is used for repair, intergranular cracks develop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Friction stir processing (FSP), which operates at much lower peak temperatures than fusion welding, was studied as a crack repair method for irradiated 304L stainless steel. A numerical simulation of the FSP process in 304L was developed to predict temperatures and recrystallized grain size in the stir zone. The model employed an Eulerian finite element approach, where flow stresses for a large range of strain rates and temperatures inherent in FSP were used as input. Temperature predictions in three locations near the stir zone were accurate to within 4%, while prediction of welding power was accurate to within 5% of experimental measurements. The predicted recrystallized grain sizes ranged from 7.6 to 10.6 μm, while the experimentally measured grains sizes in the same locations ranged from 6.0 to 7.6 μm. The maximum error in predicted recrystallized grain size was about 39%, but the associated stir zone hardness from the predicted grain sizes was only different from the experiment by about 10%. © 2019",10.1016/j.jmst.2018.10.021

To assess the secrecy level of the proposed scheme, three types of decoding strategies are evaluated: a matching decoder which knows the positions of all inserted bits inside the blocklength and tries to estimate them using the same decoding techniques, a blind decoder which treats all the frozen bits as the same value, and a random decoder which considers those dynamic bits as random at the receiver. Results are presented in terms of the system security gap, assuming an adaptive decoding strategy. It is shown that the system achieves combined secrecy and reliability.

eb48a5cd-a881-4cd5-aa2f-42d8bfa33672,"Direct Relative Edge Optimization, A Robust Alternative for Pose Graph Optimization",2019,"Pose graph optimization is a common problem in robotics and associated fields. Most commonly, pose graph optimization is performed by finding the set of pose estimates which are the most likely for a given set of measurements. In some situations, arbitrarily large errors in pose graph initialization are unavoidable and can cause these pose-based methods to diverge or fail especially in cases where global inputs become available after some time after initialization. This letter details the parameterization of the classic pose graph problem in a relative context, optimizing directly over relative edge constraints between vertices in the pose graph and not on the poses themselves. Unlike previous literature on relative optimization, this letter details relative optimization over an entire pose graph, instead of a subset of edges, resulting in greater robustness to arbitrarily large errors than the classic pose-based or prior relative edge-based methods. Several small-scale simulation comparison studies, along with single and multi-agent hardware experiments, are presented. Results point to relative edge optimization as a strong candidate for solving real-world pose graph optimization problems that contain large heading propagation or initialization errors. © 2016 IEEE.",10.1109/LRA.2019.2896478

Three different compressive strengths of mortar, grout, and concrete masonry units were used. Grouts were made without and with a shrinkage-compensating admixture. The various components were combined to construct several hollow and grouted prisms, which were then tested. The results show that very high-strength blocks were not as efficient as medium-strength blocks and that there was a difference between the compressive strengths of ungrouted and grouted masonry; depending on the combination of the materials used, grouted masonry can be less or more efficient than ungrouted masonry. For one combination of materials, the shrinkage-compensating admixture was shown to be effective in reducing the grout shrinkage, and the grouted prisms constructed with that combination of materials were more efficient than their hollow prisms counterpart. Grouted prisms constructed with grouts without the shrinkage-compensating admixture were, on average, less efficient than hollow prisms. The efficiency of grouted masonry depends on many factors including compatibility of deformation between the masonry components, compaction of the grout, shrinkage characteristics of the grout, block geometry, and bond between grout and block. Further research is needed to determine the influence of these factors and obtain a complete understanding of the behavior and capacity of high strength masonry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.037

The apparatus developed in this research included an impactor unit, a moving platform, a microphone for air-coupled sensing, a distance measurement instrument, and signal processing modules. Given the absence of an existing universal threshold for differentiating among intact and delaminated areas using the new device, a delamination detection threshold value was determined in a first field demonstration also involving chain dragging and coring of a concrete bridge deck. While the maps of the air-coupled impact-echo data and chain-dragging data exhibit a high degree of similarity and are highly consistent with the results of coring, a quantitative method of comparison also demonstrates the utility of the new device across a broad range of delamination percentages. Specifically, the results indicate that the percentage of the deck area determined to be delaminated using impact-echo testing was within 3 percentage points of that determined to be delaminated using chain dragging for 10 of the 13 deck test sections, which generally exhibited delamination percentages ranging from 7 to 21%. Finally, testing with the new device was more than seven times faster than chain dragging. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10921-019-0566-9

Because of the combined role of transmit and receive arrays in this processing for monostatic MIMO radar, mutual coupling present in these arrays impacts the beamforming in a unique way. This paper presents a mathematical model of a MIMO radar with coupled antennas and appropriate radio frequency circuitry. Application of the model to evaluate radar detection of a single target demonstrates that coupling can result in target detection angles that are in error by as much as 12° and increase beamformer response sidelobe levels by as much as 8 dB. The results also show that a simple matching network can improve detection performance, particularly when array mutual coupling is high. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2018.2888702

When N<ω, evanescent waves are generated. Although the amplitude and kinetic energy of evanescent waves decay rapidly, if the wave reaches a turning depth, where N=ω, and moves into a region where N>ω, the evanescent wave becomes an internal wave. This work expands upon previous research of varying stratifications by investigating the kinetic energy density in internal waves generated by evanescent waves passing through a turning depth. An analytical model is presented and compared to synthetic schlieren experiments of two Gaussian-shaped topographies. The model and experiments both indicate that the kinetic energy density of internal waves increases with decreasing topographic slope, when the distance between the topography and the turning depth decreases and when the average Froude number in the evanescent region is close to one.

In order to study the embrittlement and recovery of steel, tensile tests were conducted on two different types of AHSS over time after hydrogen charging. Concentration measurements and hydrogen microprinting were carried out at the same time steps to visualize the hydrogen behavior during recovery. The diffusible hydrogen concentration was found to decay exponentially, and empirical relations were found for both types of steel. Hydrogen concentration decay rates were determined to be -0.355 /hr in TBF-980, and -0.225 /hr in DP-980. Hydrogen concentration thresholds for embrittlement were found to be 1.04 mL/100 g for TBF, and 0.87 mL/100 g for DP steel. TBF steel is predicted to recover from embrittlement within 4.2 h, compared to 7.2 h in DP steel. A two-factor method of evaluating recovery from embrittlement, requiring hydrogen concentration threshold and decay rate, is explained for use in predicting recovery after exposure to hydrogen. Anisotropic hydrogen diffusion rates were also observed on the surface of both steels for a short time after charging, as hydrogen left the surface through <001> and <101> grains faster than grains with <111> orientations. This could be explained by differences in surface energies between the different orientations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.09.039

This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher NPV than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research, and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4042335

This work explores the impact of a changing projected surface area and varying apparent radiative properties on the net radiative heat transfer of an accordion fold comprised of V-grooves. The net radiative heat transfer of an accordion tessellation is obtained by a thermal energy balance at the cavity openings with radiative properties of the cavities given as a function of various cavity parameters. Results of the analytical model are experimentally confirmed. An accordion tessellation, constructed of stainless-steel shim stock, is positioned to achieve a specified fold angle and placed in a vacuum environment while heated by Joule heating. A thermal camera records the apparent temperature of the cavity openings for various fold angles. Results are compared to apparent temperatures predicted with the analytical model. Analytically and experimentally obtained temperatures agree within 5% and all measurements fall within experimental uncertainty. For diffusely irradiated surfaces, the decrease in projected surface area dominates, causing a continuous decrease in net radiative heat transfer for a collapsing accordion fold. Highly reflective specular surfaces exposed to diffuse irradiation experience large turn-down ratios (7.5× reduction in heat transfer) in the small angle ranges. Specular surfaces exposed to collimated irradiation achieve a turn down ratio of 3.35 between V-groove angles of 120 deg and 150 deg. The approach outlined here may be extended to modeling the net radiative heat transfer for other origami tessellations. © 2019 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4042442

Of the most widely used energy harvesters, piezoelectric generators can generate more electric charge than their triboelectric counterparts with similar device size, thus are more suitable to make compact wearable devices. However, most high-power piezoelectric generators are made from lead zirconate titanate, making them undesirable for wearable applications due to the toxic lead element. In this study, a flexible piezoelectric generator (F-PEG) is fabricated with chemically stable and biocompatible Group-III-nitride (III-N) thin film by a layer-transfer method. The III-N thin-film F-PEG can generate an open-circuit voltage of 50 V, a short-circuit current of 15 µA, and a maximum power of 167 µW at a load resistance of 5 MΩ. Applications of the III-N thin-film F-PEG are demonstrated by directly powering electronics such as light-emitting diodes and electric watches, and by charging commercial capacitors and batteries to operate an optical pulse sensor.

While FPGAs provide a number of important benefits to cloud computing environments, they are susceptible to radiation-induced soft errors, which can lead to silent data corruption or system instability. Although soft errors within a single FPGA occur infrequently, soft errors in large-scale FPGAs systems can occur at a relatively high rate. This paper investigates the failure rate of several FPGA applications running within an FPGA cloud computing node by performing fault injection experiments to determine the susceptibility of these applications to soft-errors. The results from these experiments suggest that silent data corruption will occur every few hours within a 100,000 node FPGA system and that such a system can only maintain high-levels of reliability for short periods of operation.

Although simulations or software models can be used to explore the design space of these applications, often the final behaviour can not be evaluated until the design is mapped to the FPGA and integrated into the target system. This may be because long run-times are required, or because the environment can not be adequately described using a software model. Once unexpected behaviour is observed, on-chip debug is notoriously difficult; typically a design is instrumented with on-chip trace buffers that record the run-time behaviour for later interrogation. In this paper, we describe instrumentation that can accelerate the process of debugging machine learning applications implemented on an FPGA. Unlike previous work, our instrumentation is optimized to take advantage of characteristics of this application domain. Our instruments gather useful domain-specific information about the observed variables instead of recording the raw values of those elements.

When failure occurs, it usually manifests as transverse buckling. Because this failure mode is closely related to transverse tissue stiffness, the purpose of this study was to develop a method for measuring the transverse Young's modulus of maize stalk rind and pith tissues. Short, disc-shaped stalk segments were used for this purpose. X-ray computed tomography was used to obtain the geometry of each specimen prior to testing. Each specimen was tested in two different configurations. Computed tomography data was used to create a specimen-specific finite element model of each test specimen. Data from the first testing configuration was used in conjunction with the finite element model to determine the Young's Modulus values for each specimen. The specimen-specific finite element models provided estimates of the stress states in the stem under transverse loading, and these stress states accurately predicted the location of failure in transverse test specimens. The entire testing method was validated using data from one test configuration to predict the structural response of each specimen during the second test configuration. © 2018",10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.12.028

This paper defines many of the problems associated with developing effective control of soft, pneumatically actuated, inflatable robots, and proposes an approach to solving a subset of these problems. We show that we can obtain a global measurement of orientation for a given soft-robot link using two different types of sensors (not including motion capture). Given the orientation measurement, it is possible to estimate relative configurations of the soft actuators and joints. In order to validate the ability to control position and orientation at the end effector, we show a new method for calibrating the coordinate frames of two unrelated measurement systems. Then, using one of our configuration estimation methods, we demonstrate its viability by performing simple behaviors with a large-scale (approximately 1.5 m long) soft-robot platform attached to the K-Rex rover at NASA Ames in an outdoor environment. Our results also show the importance of soft-robot kinematic calibration and the sensitivity of a soft robot to simple perturbations in the structure like deflation and reinflation. Finally, we show that end effector error can be significantly reduced by doing a form of servoing. In summary, our approach and demonstrations show effective soft-robot configuration estimation and control for large-scale soft robots capable of performing manipulation tasks. © 1996-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TMECH.2018.2878228
55c5e3a2-cd61-4eff-8e9d-a062df018c3c,Influence of micro-structured superhydrophobic surfaces on nucleation and natural convection in a heated pool,2019,"This work experimentally explores sub-boiling pool nucleation on micro-structured superhydrophobic surfaces. All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40–90 °C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.10.030

In the U.S., these efforts have resulted in national curricula and increased local expectations. The research on actual implementation often reports on efforts of single schools or districts. This paper provides a high-level description of the practices and challenges of teaching CS in K-12 across an entire state. To better understand how these efforts might increase CS education for all, we surveyed every public school in the state of Utah and analyzed enrollment data for all 19 Utah CS courses. The survey consisted of closed and open-ended questions about each school's current CS practices and personnel. Schools from 39 of 42 public school districts responded (including charter schools) representing 46.3% of the state's high schools, 39.3% of middle/junior high schools, and 28% of elementary schools. Course data indicated that enrollment in CS courses increased considerably in the past five years after the introduction of newer, more fundamental courses. Despite the general enrollment increase, there has been a markedly smaller increase in student enrollment in more advanced CS courses. In this paper, we discuss these and other surprising results, as well as challenges that educators reported in promoting and teaching CS. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985707

The capsule moves and is deformed by the action of a pulsatile flow inside the tube with a non-null mean velocity. This configuration can be found in the nature and in many bioengineering systems where artificial capsules are driven by micro-pumps through micro-channels. The capsule is considered as a thin hyperelastic membrane, which encloses an internal fluid. As it has been demonstrated in the literature, this model represents a wide range of artificial capsules, for example, the alginate-based capsules, typically used in bioengineering applications. A hybrid isogeometric finite element method and boundary element method based on a T-spline discretization and formulated in the time domain is used to solve the mechanical and hydrodynamical equations. The influence of the relative rigidity of the membrane, frequency and amplitude of the pulsatile flow is studied. Results show that the behavior of the capsule differs from steady flows and it depends strongly on the frequency of the flow and mechanical characteristic of the capsule. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jmbbm.2018.10.025

This result implies that system behavior may become simpler as more components are added. We review necessary conditions for the result and present some simulation studies to assess how well it holds in systems with finite numbers of components.

From the streamlines that terminate on the array element loads, a geometrical shape can be assigned to the effective area of the array. These concepts provide an intuitive tool for understanding mutual coupling effects in antenna arrays. The decrease in directivity associated with mutual coupling effects, the so-called element-gain paradox, can be explained by the overlap of the element effective area shapes. The critical element spacing for the element-gain paradox effect can be predicted from the effective area shape for a single isolated array element. Antenna design for minimizing mutual coupling, which is of interest in multiple input multiple output communications systems, magnetic resonance imaging arrays, astronomical arrays, and other applications, can be guided by analysing the effective area shape for a single isolated array element. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2018.2880049

Utilizing a variable delay line and the standard SAR logic, the proposed technique reduces power by downsizing the DAC drivers and digital logic without decreasing the sampling rate.

In addition, this brief proposes a ""partially interdigitated"" DAC layout to reduce the bottom-plate parasitic capacitance to minimize the DAC power.

Running such a large number of crack propagation simulations presents a significant computational challenge, making reduced-order models (ROMs) attractive for this task. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop ROMs that have sufficient accuracy and low computational cost so that these upscaling simulations can be readily performed. However, constructing ROMs for these complex simulations presents its own challenge. Here, we present and compare four different approaches for reduced-order modeling of brittle crack propagation in geomaterials. These methods rely on machine learning (ML) and graph-theoretic algorithms to approximate key aspects of the brittle crack problem. These methods also incorporate different physics-based assumptions in order to reduce the training requirements while maintaining accurate physics as much as possible. Results from the ROMs are directly compared against a high-fidelity model of brittle crack propagation. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the ROMs are discussed, and we conclude that combining smart physics-informed feature engineering with highly trainable ML models provides the best performance. The ROMs considered here have computational costs that are orders-of-magnitude less than the cost associated with high-fidelity physical models while maintaining good accuracy. © 2018",10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.10.036

We identify a shortcoming and training obstacle of the recent Stochastic Multiple Choice Learning (sMCL) algorithm. When an ensemble of neural networks trains under sMCL, the best performing model receives the majority of parameter updates at the expense of other ensemble members. We refer to this sMCL training issue as Alpha Model Domination (AMD) and empirically demonstrate that AMD does not resolve itself with longer training time. We introduce several novel MCL loss functions that both avoid AMD and yield statistically significant improvements in oracle accuracy (OA) compared to sMCL. Using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet classification datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed loss functions. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00142

When a model of a power system is to be compared with measurements taken at discrete times, it can be interpreted as a mapping from parameter space into a data or prediction space. Generically, model mappings can be interpreted as manifolds with dimensionality equal to the number of structurally identifiable parameters. Empirically it is observed that model mappings often correspond to bounded manifolds. We propose a new definition of practical identifiability based the topological definition of a manifold with boundary. In many ways, our proposed definition extends the properties of structural identifiability. We construct numerical approximations to geodesics on the model manifold and use the results, combined with insights derived from the mathematical form of the equations, to identify combinations of practically identifiable and unidentifiable parameters. We give several examples of application to dynamic power systems models. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/NAPS.2018.8600617

The optimized flight path is obtained by using nonlinear model predictive control to solve flight and energy system dynamics over a 24 hour period with a 15 second time resolution. The optimization objective is to maximize the total energy in the system while flying a station-keeping mission, staying within a 3 km radius and above 60,000 ft. The propulsion system design optimization minimizes the total energy required to fly the optimal path. It uses a combination of blade element momentum theory, blade composite structures, empirical motor and motor controller mass data, as well as a first order motor performance model. The battery optimization seeks to optimally size the battery for a circular orbit. Fixed point iteration between these optimization frameworks yields a flight path and propulsion system that slightly decreases solar capture, but signif-icantly decreases power expended. Fully coupling the trajectory and design optimizations with this level of accuracy is infeasible with current computing resources.

There are a variety of factors that affect how well an area is surveyed. We specifically analyzed the effect both vehicle properties and communication had on the swarm search performance. We used non-dimensionalization to examine the effect vehicle properties had on search performance so the results can be applied to any domain size with any number and type of vehicle. We found that even if vehicles could only sense 10% of the grid area at any given time step, 92% of the grid could still be searched by using a vehicle with good maneuverability and endurance. Conversely, if the chosen vehicle had poor maneuverability 92% of the grid could still be searched by keeping the endurance high and increasing the amount of area the vehicles could sense at one time to 70% of the domain area. In addition, we also examined four communication cases with different amounts of information regarding vehicle location. We found communication increased search performance by at least 6.3%.

Time-accurate, full annulus simulations were carried out to capture and analyze the processes leading to stall inception for uniform inlet conditions. Unsteady interaction between tip clearance flow and the detached normal shock inside of the blade passages became more prevalent at flow rates close to stall, and this unsteadiness likely provides a way for leading edge spillage to occur and initiate the stall process. Although reversed flow at the trailing edge plane was not observed to be more prevalent in simulations near stall than in simulations away from stall, the phenomenon was shown to occur in blade passages that were approaching a stall cell. Understanding the physical processes that lead to stall inception allows fan designers to design more robust fans that can safely take advantage of the better performance associated with operating closer to stall. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Technology that combines accurate temperature measurement and 3D spatial control of the temperature distribution is limited by common 2D layer-based microfluidic fabrication techniques but can be realized with 3D printed microfluidic chips. This work presents an iterative process to create a microfluidic chip using multimaterial 3D printing to improve temperature sensing and create an even temperature around a target volume. Through an iterative process, verification is presented of fluorophore viability (specifically CdTe quantum dots) after being secured in place by cured PR48 3D printing resin, thus confirming the possibility of fluorescent thermometry as an accurate non-contact temperature sensing method. Numerical analyses of various geometries of chip design iterations are also presented verifying spatially even heating due to the placement of heating sources in the microfluidic chip.

Distributed electric propulsion could potentially decrease takeoff distances enough to enable thousands of potential intercity runways. This conceptual study explores the effects of a retrofit of open-bladed electric propulsion units. To model and explore the design space, blade element momentum method, vortex lattice method, linear-beam finite element analysis, classical laminate theory, composite failure, empirically based blade noise modeling, motor and motor-controller mass models, and gradient-based optimization are used. With liftoff time of seconds and the safe total field length for this aircraft type undefined, this paper focused on the minimum conceptual takeoff distance. It was found that 16 propellers could reduce the takeoff distance by over 50% compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 20.5 m to clear a 50 ft (15.24 m) obstacle. It was also found that, when decreasing the allowable noise by approximately 10 dBa, the 8-propeller case performed the best with a 43% reduction in takeoff distance compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a noise-restricted conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 95 m. Copyright © 2019 by Kevin R. Moore and Andrew Ning.

This paper proposes an automated process to identify mode shapes from gray-scale images of compressor blades within a jetengine. This work introduces mode shape identification using principal component analysis (PCA), similar to approaches in facial and other recognition tasks in computer vision. This technique calculates the projected values of potentially linearly correlated values onto P-linearly orthogonal axes, where P is the number of principal axes that define a subset space. Classification was done using support vector machines (SVM). Using the PCA and SVM algorithm, approximately 5300 training images representative of 16 different modes were used to create a classifier. The classifier achieved on average 98% accuracy when tested using a test set of approximately 2000 images given P D 70. The results suggest that using digital images to perform mode shape identification can be achieved with high accuracy.

This year we explored further integration of Instagram as an academic tool. This study included twenty-two undergraduate participants who prototyped five new classroom uses of Instagram: posting full student presentations, utilising Instagram desktop view as the primary in-class presentation tool, employing templates enabling a cohesive visual identity and a simple search process, and methods to enhance student comments. We surveyed course participants mid-semester asking students about their personal Instagram use, the value and purpose they felt Instagram had in the course, and on the usefulness of the presentation templates. We learned that while the majority of students use Instagram in their daily life, few of them make comments on personal or course posts and will only do so for credit. We also learned that while students might not enjoy using Instagram in the course, they find it of value and highly meaningful. Finally, the students prefer using formatted templates over an open style like PowerPoint to build their presentations in. These templates enabled the students to post their full presentations and created a visual cohesiveness for the account while providing a rudimentary search process for individual posts. We will continue using Instagram in future courses with the exception of requiring comments. We believe that students will reference their class posts in years to come, and as they do, it will re-enforce their design knowledge and provide evidence of their personal growth. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

This study is inspired by existing play studies that continue to demonstrate the positive relationship between the freedom to be playful and psychological wellbeing. The methods used in this study include a consolidation of 99 anonymous free-response student surveys over the course of six semesters that are organised in terms of stress level and frustration word indicators. These comments provide a historical baseline for understanding the student perceptions of their classroom learning experience as it relates to their emotional wellbeing. We then compare those comments with comments made after a semester of playful interventions to discover how they differ. The results indicate that levels of “stress” and “frustration” were decreased with playful interventions, however students spent more hours outside of class lecture on their assignments and the overall student course rating nominally decreased. These results are discussed as well as how pedagogical changes to traditional classroom environments such as this may not only impact stress and frustration but also significantly contribute to the holistic learning experience for university students. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of one’s moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication.

However, such interactions are uncommon in practice. Typically, the players' goals, action sets, and payoffs change from encounter to encounter, often in ways the players cannot easily model or control. These more realistic interactions, which we model as a form of stochastic game called interaction games (IGs), have attributes which prohibit the straightforward application of many often-used algorithms developed for RGs. In this paper, we generalize several algorithms previously designed for RGs, and explore their behavior and performance in IGs.

A simplified geometry with a vertical coal hopper feeding into a 0.635-cm diameter horizontal pipe was used to represent key elements of the feed system. Coal particles were transported with 20-atm CO2 gas. The feed system was required to maintain a steady flow of gas and solids at a coal flow rate of approximately 3.8 g/s and a CO2 to coal mass ratio in the range 1-2. Sensitivity of model results to mesh size and particle interaction sub-model settings was assessed. Two design concepts were evaluated. A gravity-fed concept was found to be infeasible due to inadequate coal flow rates even at very high CO2 to coal flow ratios. This was due to gravitational forces being insufficient to move the pressurized coal from the hopper into the CO2 stream at the desired rate. A fluidized bed concept was found to provide the desired coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio. CO2 injected at the hopper base first fluidized the vertical coal bed before transporting it through a horizontal exit pipe. A second CO2 inlet downstream of the hopper exit pipe was used to dilute the fluidized coal and increase pipe velocities to minimize coal drop out. The amount of coal transported from the hopper was dependent on the net CO2 hopper flow but independent of the CO2 dilution flow. This meant that the coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio could be controlled independently. Pipe exit coal flow rates were found to fluctuate at levels acceptable for steady burner operation.

Participants generally gave high marks to the methods studied, and many expressed an interest in using 2FA to provide more security for their sensitive online accounts. We also conducted a within-subjects laboratory study with 30 participants to assess the general usability of the setup procedure for the five methods. While a few participants experienced difficulty setting up a hardware token and a one-time password, in general, users found the methods easy to set up. © is held by the author/owner.",

A usability study of the authentication ceremony of secure messaging applications",2019,"The effective security provided by secure messaging applications depends heavily on users completing an authentication ceremony-a sequence of manual operations enabling users to verify they are indeed communicating with one another. Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances. We conclude by exploring user threat models, finding significant gaps in user awareness and understanding. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.",

Twenty locations where raised medians were installed in Utah from 2002 to 2014 were used in this analysis. A model was developed that analyzed raised medians by access category (AC). Only three AC were represented in the data. Regression plots depicting a decrease in crashes before and after installation and crash modification factor (CMF) plots presenting the CMF values estimated for different vehicle miles traveled values were created as output from the before-after model. Overall, installing a raised median gives an approximate average reduction of 53 percent for all crashes. Individual AC analysis yielded results ranging from 32 to 44 percent reduction for all severity groups except severity 4 and 5. When the model was only run for crash severity 4 and 5, a larger reduction of 57 to 58 percent was found. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784482575.009

Helping users find and complete the authentication ceremony in signal,2019,"The security guarantees of secure messaging applications are contingent upon users performing an authentication ceremony, which typically involves verifying the fingerprints of encryption keys. However, recent lab studies have shown that users are unable to do this without being told in advance about the ceremony and its importance. A recent study showed that even with this instruction, the time it takes users to find and complete the ceremony is excessively long-about 11 minutes. To remedy these problems, we modified Signal to include prompts for the ceremony and also simplified the ceremony itself. To gauge the effect of these changes, we conducted a between-subject user study involving 30 pairs of participants. Our study methodology includes no user training and only a small performance bonus to encourage the secure behavior. Our results show that users are able to both find and complete the ceremony more quickly in our new version of Signal. Despite these improvements, many users are still unsure or confused about the purpose of the authentication ceremony. We discuss the need for better risk communication and methods to promote trust. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",

Exploring mental models of encryption,2019,"Mental models are a driving force in the way users interact with systems, and thus have important implications for design. This is especially true for encryption because the cost of mistakes can be disastrous. Nevertheless, until now, mental models of encryption have only been tangentially explored as part of more broadly focused studies. In this work, we present the first directed effort at exploring user perceptions of encryption: both mental models of what encryption is and how it works as well as views on its role in everyday life. We performed 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States, using both standard interview techniques and a diagramming exercise where participants visually demonstrated their perception of the encryption process. We identified four mental models of encryption which, though varying in detail and complexity, ultimately reduce to a functional abstraction of restrictive access control and naturally coincide with a model of symmetric encryption. Additionally, we find the impersonal use of encryption to be an important part of participants' models of security, with a widespread belief that encryption is frequently employed by service providers to encrypt data at rest. In contrast, the personal use of encryption is viewed as reserved for illicit or immoral activity, or for the paranoid. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",
bbffed1b-af70-43c1-9494-8ac8635d98cf,Frequency response of the leap motion controller and its suitability for measuring tremor,2019,"Although tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, it is evaluated using relatively coarse clinical scales. We propose to measure tremor in clinical settings using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC), which is a markerless motion capture sensor that has a low cost, zero set-up time, and dynamic accuracy of 1.2 mm. However, the frequency response of the LMC has not been characterized, so its ability to track oscillations such as tremor is unknown. To characterize the frequency response of the LMC, we measured the position of a mannequin hand simultaneously with the LMC and a high-resolution encoder while the mannequin hand oscillated at various combinations of frequency (1–15 Hz) and amplitudes (0.01–30 mm). We calculated the magnitude ratio and phase shift of the LMC and found the bandwidth of the LMC to range from 0–3 Hz to 0–5 Hz for tremor amplitudes greater than the dynamic accuracy. This bandwidth is too small to accurately measure most tremors. However, we developed an inverse filter to estimate the actual tremor amplitude and phase despite the limited bandwidth. Over the combinations of frequency and amplitude mentioned above, the inverse filter estimated the actual tremor amplitude and phase with errors of 3% and 2%, respectively. © 2018",10.1016/j.medengphy.2018.11.001

Even a small frequency offset between radio transmitters and receivers can cause phase information to be lost, so a system to align the phases is required to reliably demodulate PSK signals. These estimators have been adapted for 16-APSK from methods originally intended for use with QPSK and CPM. These methods consist of a coarse search and a fine search with an optional dichotomous search to improve accuracy. We analyze the estimator error variance and bit error rate associated with several methods of frequency estimation. These estimators exhibit small estimate error and variance and can provide bit error rates close to the ideal AWGN BER. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering. All rights reserved.",

Given the fact that coded systems tend to operate at lower signal-to-noise ratios than uncoded systems, the synchronizer must operate at these lower signal-to-noise ratios. For a 30 kHz frequency offset and a 10 Mbit/s 16-APSK signal, the conventional phase lock loop (PLL) system does not achieve consistent lock to be a useful approach. Consequently, a blind feed-forward approach, based on the FFT, and an initialized feedback approach based on the PLL were examined. The feed-forward estimator is capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB using 1024 symbols. The feedback estimator, initialized using a feed-forward estimate based on 1024 symbols is also capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ≥ 6 dB. Both synchronizers require a sufficiently good blind estimate: the estimate based on 2014 symbols appears to be the minimum value to achieve good performance. © 2019 International Foundation for Telemetering.

Many origami structures can be thought of as a compliant mechanism because, like compliant mechanisms, its function is performed through the elastic deformation of its members. This stored strain energy could prove useful. There are opportunities using strain energy to develop approaches to deploy particular mechanical systems. In order to better understand the principles of self-actuation and promote the designs of such systems, a taxonomy of deployable origami mechanisms is presented. This taxonomy demonstrates that there are several different types of deployable origami mechanisms and provides an organizational method to better understand the design space. Characteristics of self deployment in concentrated, deployable origami strain energy mechanisms with internal actuation are identified and examples of strain energy based deployment are provided.

These projects involve student teams designing and implementing products or solutions for communities in need, often in developing nations. There has been much research done relating to pedagogy and the impact of these programs on student learning. However, less research has been done on measuring the impact of these programs on the affected communities. This paper examines factors that practitioners believe are related to successfully delivering a desirable and transferable solution to affected communities. The authors identified 46 distinct factors from the literature that implicitly or explicitly are suggested to contribute to successful project outcomes. Formed as postulates in this paper, these 46 factors have been separated into 5 categories to assist understanding and implementing these factors into service learning programs. Lastly, different methods of analyzing and measuring project success and impact are discussed. Future methods for proving the viability of the 46 postulates are discussed as well.

The origami stability integration method (OSIM) presented in this paper provides an approach for graphically combining various techniques to achieve stability. Techniques are divided into four groups based on whether they are intrinsic or extrinsic to the origami pattern and whether they exhibit differentiable or non-differentiable energy storage behaviors. These categorizations can help designers select appropriate techniques for their application. The paper also contains design considerations and resources for several intrinsic techniques. Finally, two case studies are presented which use the OSIM and the technique guidelines to conceptualize stability in origami-based devices. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2019-98168

Regional-sandwiching of the compliant sheet is used to create mountain/valley assignments for each fold about a vertex, constraining motion to a single branch of folding. Strain energy in deflected flexible members is used to enable self-deployment. This work presents the methods to design origami-based mechanisms using the ReCS technique, including volume trimming at the vertex of the compliant sheet and of the panels used in the sandwich. Physical models of a simple single fold mechanism and a degree-four vertex mechanism are presented to demonstrate the ReCS technique using acrylic panels and spring steel. Consideration is given to the risk of yielding of the compliant sheet due to parasitic motion with possible mitigation of yielding by decreasing the thickness of the sheet.

The course is offered as a study abroad program where faculty lead a group of students across several countries to learn about global product development. This is accomplished in a 2-3 week time period consisting of visits to companies and universities as well as participation in cultural activities. While much research has been done on the benefits of study abroad, it remains unclear how effective study abroad programs are at helping engineering students, especially short-term study abroad programs. The purpose of this paper is to present and examine the benefits of a short-term, study abroad program to engineering students. Data was collected from students who have taken the Global Product Development Course over the past 15 years in a mixed methods survey. Trends show that technical and cultural visits positively effect engineering students in their perception of global product development.

In this paper two categories of kirigami-based models are presented for stopping the fold motion of individual creases using deployable hard stops. These models are transcrease (across a crease) and deploy from a flat sheet. The first category is planar and has behavior similar to a four-bar linkage. The second category is spherical and behaves like a degree-4 origami vertex. These models are based on the zero-thickness assumption of paper and can be applied to origami patterns made from thin materials, limiting the motion of the base origami pattern through self-interference within the original facets. Model parameters are based on a desired fold or dihedral angle, as well as facet dimensions. Examples show model benefits and limitations. Copyright © 2019 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2019-98056

Arrays of silicon lances were made using photolithographic and STS DRIE Bosch techniques. A nanoinjector device was also made to accept the silicon lance arrays and perform nanoinjections. Nanoinjections were performed on Arabidopsis and cotton cotyledons. Changes in the force applied during a nanoinjection and varying the number of repeated nanoinjections on the same cotyledon were observed. Too much force or too many repeated injections caused physical damage to the cotyledon. An optimal force and number of repeated injections can be performed without causing physical damage to the cotyledon. Several injections using DNA were performed without successful transfection of the leaves. Possible reasons for this failure to transfect were explored. Copyright © 2019 ASME.,10.1115/DETC2019-98019
e2f4386c-e81b-465e-9380-589cfb244a68,Machine learning for evaluating the social impact of engineered products: A framework,2019,"Evaluating the social impact indicators of engineered products is crucial to better understanding how products affect individuals’ lives and discover how to design for positive social impact. Most existing methods for evaluating social impact indicators require direct human interaction with users of a product, such as one-on-one interviews. These interactions produce high-fidelity data that are rich in information but provide only a single snapshot in time of the product’s impacts and are less frequently collected due to the significant human resources and cost associated with obtaining them. A framework is proposed that describes how low-fidelity data passively obtained using remote sensors, satellites, and digital technology can be collected and correlated with high-fidelity, low-frequency data using machine learning. Using this framework provides an inexpensive way to continuously monitor the social impact indicators of products by augmenting high-fidelity, low-frequency data with low-fidelity, continuously-collected data using machine learning. We illustrate an application of this framework by demonstrating how it can be used to examine the gender-related social impact indicators of water pumps in Uganda. The provided example uses a deep learning model to correlate pump handle movement (measured via an integrated motion unit) with user type (man, woman, or child) of 1,200 hand pump users.

The model demonstrates that the design is capable of staying in motion with continual input pressure (up to at least a time stamp of 1 second), and that an average power output of 9.47 µW over 5 ms can be achieved.

Mechanical hand pumps have a long history of helping people access clean ground water for drinking and daily use. Among the most ubiquitous are the India Mark II and III pump systems, for which there are more than 4,000,000 installed across the world. These are estimated to serve between 600M and 1B people. All pumps degrade in performance over time, requiring service; many do not receive it causing pumps to become dysfunctional. The purpose of this paper is to establish a baseline for nitrile seal performance of India Mark II hand pump systems. Understanding off-the-shelf performance and using it as a baseline is an important step toward understanding degradation of performance over time, which is the focus of a much larger study to understand – mechanically and socially – how hand pumps perform, degrade, and ultimately meet human needs. In this paper, 110 off-the-shelf nitrile seals that were purchased in Uganda were tested and the following was characterized: (i) geometric variation, (ii) material variation, (iii) leak performance, and (iv) correlation between these. The seal leak performance was found to be very robust to variations in geometry and material at zero cycles. This important baseline supports our future work to understand how and to what degree seals become sensitive to geometric and material degradation during use.

This motivates the necessity of having a neutral design standard for CAD models to facilitate generation, customization, and parameterization across multiple systems. Current standards often fail to incorporate file history, design intent, and are designed to be an intermediary format for translation. This research proposes a simplified, neutral design format based on XML that can be used to generate models in different CAD systems and versions. The format utilizes advanced features such as finding tools to address issues that arise due to directionality and selection without a user interface. To test the feasibility of the neutral format, scripts were made that generated a quadcopter and an airplane wing rib.

Predicting and measuring heat transfer is critical to the design and operation of new boiler concepts. The individual contributions of gas and particle phases are dependent on gas and particle concentration, particle size, and gas and particle temperature which vary with location relative to the flame. A method for measuring the contributions of both gas and particle radiation capable of being applied in harsh high temperature and pressure environments has been demonstrated using emission from particles and water vapor using an optical fiber probe transmitting a signal to a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The method was demonstrated in four environments of varying gas and particle loading using natural gas and pulverized wood flames in a down-fired 130 kWth cylindrical reactor. The method generates a gas and particle temperature, gas concentrations (H2O and CO2), total gas and particle intensities, and gas and particle total effective emissivity from line-of-sight emission measurements. For the conditions measured, downstream of the luminous flame zone, water vapor and CO2 radiation were the dominant modes of heat transfer (effective emissivity 0.13-0.19) with particles making a minor contribution (effective emissivity 0.01-0.02). Within a lean natural gas flame, soot emission was low (effective emissivity 0.02) compared to gas (0.14) but within a luminous flame of burning wood particles (500 μm mean diameter) the particles (soot and burning wood) produced a higher effective emissivity (0.17) than the gas (0.12).

As example devices, we first examine 3D printed pumps, followed by two types of selectable ratio mixer pumps, a linear dilution mixer pump (LDMP) and a parallelized dilution mixer pump (PDMP), which occupy volumes of only 1.5 mm 3 and 2.6 mm 3, respectively. The LDMP generates a selectable dilution ratio from a linear set of possibilities, while the PDMP generates a denser set of possible dilutions with a maximum dilution ratio of 1/16. The PDMP also incorporates a new 4-to-1 valve to simultaneously control 4 inlet channels. To characterize LDMP and PDMP operation and performance, we present a new, low-cost video method to directly measure the relative concentration of an absorptive dye on a pixel-by-pixel basis for each video frame. Using this method, we find that 6 periods of the active mixer that forms the core of the LDMP and PDMP are sufficient to fully mix the fluid, and that the generated concentrations track the designed dilution ratios as expected. The LDMP mixes 20 nl per 4.6 s mixer pump period, while the PDMP uses parallelized input pumps to process the same fluid volume with greater choice of dilution ratios in a 3.6 s period. © 2019 Author(s).",10.1063/1.5070068

In this study, we present, for the first time, combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometric (SE) studies of aluminum oxidation as a function of MgF2 over a range of layer thickness (0-6 nm). We also show for the first time, dynamic SE data which, with appropriate modeling, tracks the extent of oxide growth every few seconds over a period of several hours after the evaporated Al + MgF2 bilayer is removed from the deposition chamber, exposing it to the air. For each SE data set, because the optical constants of ultrathin metals films depend strongly on deposition conditions and their thickness, the optical constants for Al, as well as the Al and Al2O3 thicknesses, were fit. SE trends were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There is a chemical shift in the Al 2s electron emission peak toward higher binding energy as the metal oxidizes to Al+3. The extent of oxide growth can be modeled from the relative area of each peak once they are corrected for the attenuation through MgF2 layer. This generates an empirical formula: oxide thickness= k∗log(t) +b, for the time-dependent aluminum-oxide thickness on aluminum surfaces protected by MgF2 as a function of MgF2 layer thickness. Here, k is a factor which depends only on MgF2 thickness, and decreases with increasing MgF2 thickness. The techniques developed can illuminate other protected mirror systems. © 2019 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2529893

The fundamental problem is that commercial tools and materials, which excel in many other application areas, have not been developed to address the unique needs of microfluidic device fabrication. Consequently, we have created our own stereolithographic 3D printer and materials that are specifically tailored to meet these needs. We review our recent work and show that flow channels as small as 18 μm x 20 μm can be reliably fabricated, as well as compact active elements such as valves and pumps. With these capabilities, we demonstrate highly integrated 3D printed microfluidic devices that measure only a few millimeters on a side, and that integrate separate chip-to-world interfaces through high density interconnects (up to 88 interconnects per square mm) that are directly 3D printed as part of a device chip. These advances open the door to 3D printing as a replacement for expensive cleanroom fabrication processes, with the additional advantage of fast (30 minute), parallel fabrication of many devices in a single print run due to their small size. © 2019 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2511369

We asked members of the computational optimization and wind communities to take part in the studies that we designed. Nine individuals participated. Case study 1 considered variations in optimization strategies for a given simple Gaussian wake model. Participants were provided with a wake model that outputs annual energy production (AEP) for an input set of wind turbine locations. Participants used an optimization method of their choosing to find an optimal wind farm layout. Case study 2 looked at trade-offs in performance resulting from variation in both physics model and optimization strategy. For case study 2, participants calculated AEP using a wake model of their choice while also using their chosen optimization method. Participants then used their wake model to calculate the AEP of all other participants’ optimized layouts. Results for case study 1 show that the best optimal wind farm layouts in this study were achieved by participants who used gradient-based optimization methods. A front-runner emerged with the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer plus Wake Expansion Continua-tion (SNOPT+WEC) optimization method, which consistently discovered the highest submitted AEP. For case study 2, two participants found a similar layout that was judged to be superior by all five participants. It is unclear if the better solution resulted from an improved optimization process, or a wake model that was more amenable to optimization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Some characteristics of the simple models may negatively influence the resulting layouts. In this paper, we perform wind farm layout optimization using a simple wake model and compare the resulting improvements to large-eddy simulation (LES) results to confirm that the layout was actually improved. We begin by describing the models used, including changes specific for use with gradient-based optimization. We then compare our models’ output to previously published model and LES results. Using the models described, we performed gradient-based wind farm layout optimization using exact gradients. Power production for the original and optimized layouts were recalculated using LES. The model and LES results were then compared. The simple models predicted an improvement in annual energy production (AEP) of 7.4%, while the LES reported an AEP improvement of 9.9%. We concluded that the improvements found by optimizing with the simple models are not just an artifact of the model characteristics, but are real improvements. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

97c6a61e-8760-4065-ab81-4742a3a877cf,Thermal properties of thin film uranium oxides and thorium oxides,2019,"Uranium and thorium oxides have critical roles as fuels in existing nuclear power plants, as well as in proposed reactor concepts. The thermal conductivity of these materials determines their ability to transfer heat from the reactor core to the surrounding coolant. Additionally, these actinide compounds are of interest in condensed matter physics because of the 5f orbitals and unique electron interaction, coupling, and scattering events that can occur. Because of the radioactivity of thorium and uranium, thin film measurements of actinide materials are used to limit the amount of operator exposure, but standard thermal characterization methods are not well suited for thin films. This paper presents the process of depositing thin film UOx and ThOx samples of nm-μm thicknesses and the results of thermal property measurements. Thin films were deposited on silicon and glass substrates via dc-magnetron sputtering using an argon/oxygen mixture as the working gas. The thermal properties of the films were measured by the Thermal Conductivity Microscope (TCM). This uses one laser to generate thermal waves and a second laser to measure the magnitude and phases of the thermal waves to obtain the conductivity of materials. The results of the research show that the UOx film properties are lower than bulk values and that the role of the substrate has a considerable effect on determining the measured properties. Future work aims at improving the deposition process. Epitaxial film growth is planned. Additional understanding of thermal property measurements is targeted.

d3be0806-a653-4e6d-bb7f-f74e064cbc45,Effects of laser ablation parameters to pattern high purity magnesium surfaces,2019,"Magnesium and magnesium-based alloys have relatively low weight and desirable mechanical properties for many applications in multiple industries including aerospace and automotive. In the past decade, due to its biocompatible nature, the medical field has expressed significant interest in magnesium for biodegradable implant applications. However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesium’s high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (λ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars. Information gathered from this study could be useful in creating more complex or finer micro-structures on magnesium and its alloys to alter their wetting or corrosion characteristics using laser ablation which is a fast, repeatable and an un-convoluted process.

Using full annulus URANS simulations, the effects of distortion as it passes through the rotor of a transonic fan at five radial locations (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span) are analyzed. The inlet distortion profile is a 90-degree sector with a 15% total pressure deficit. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. Results are presented and compared for three operating points (near-stall, design, and choke). These results are used to explain the relationship between inlet total pressure distortion, pressure-induced swirl, total pressure distortion transfer, total temperature distortion generation, and circumferential rotor power variation. It is shown that very large changes in pressure-induced swirl and distortion transfer and generation occur between near-stall and design, but only small changes are seen between design and choke. The greatest changes are shown to be near the tip. Local power variations are shown to correlate with total pressure distortion transfer and total temperature distortion generation.

It pressurizes the fluid to delay the onset of cavitation, which can adversely affect performance in a centrifugal pump. In this paper, the performance of a water pump inducer has been explored with and without the implementation of a stability control device (SCD). This device is an inlet cover bleed system that removes high-energy fluid near the blade leading edge and reinjects it back upstream. The research was conducted by running multiphase, time-accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations at the design flow coefficient and at low, off-design flow coefficients. The suction performance and stability for the same inducer with and without the implementation of the SCD has been explored. An improvement in stability and suction performance was observed when the SCD was implemented. Without the SCD, the inducer developed backflow at the blade tip, which led to rotating cavitation and larger rotordynamic forces. With the SCD, no significant cavitation instabilities developed, and the rotordynamic forces remained small. The lack of cavitation instabilities also allowed the inducer to operate at lower inlet pressures, increasing the suction performance of the inducer. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4040098

The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle dynamics demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TCST.2017.2773027

In the considered configuration, a jet flame issues from a central nozzle into a vitiated coflow of hot combustion products from an array of lean H2/air flames. Centreline profiles for mixture fraction, temperature and mass fraction of O2 and OH obtained from ODT simulations with a planar and cylindrical formulation are shown and compared to measurements from Cabra et al. (2005). Additionally, two-dimensional renderings of the jet flame and scatter plots of temperature versus mixture fraction and OH mass fraction versus mixture fraction are provided. Although the application of ODT for reactive flows in jet configurations is not novel, the chosen lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow represents a challenge for the model. The accurate representation of the subtle interactions of the hot coflow products with the cold unburnt jet flow are crucial for the reaction and autoignition of the jet (Cabra et al., 2005). Considering the reduced order of the model and the taken assumptions, the achieved results reasonably match with the measurement data. © 2019 International Symposium on Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena, TSFP.

5e46003a-c926-4016-8d55-740915e4c29f,Changes in perceptions of ethical climate among undergraduate engineering students,2019,"Promoting ethical conduct and social responsibility among undergraduate engineering graduates has been an ongoing challenge for many universities around the world. Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

However, this has the effect of reducing user autonomy by diminishing the role personal values and priorities play in the decision-making process. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative approach that emphasizes users' comprehension over compliance, with the goal of helping users to make more informed decisions regarding their own security. To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost. We also find that system trust is a major factor in users' interpretation of system determinations of risk, and that properly communicating risk requires an understanding of user perceptions of the larger security ecosystem in whole. © is held by the author/owner.",

The UICPM is a Bayesian generalized linear model that creates distributions of the expected number of crashes at each intersection, compares the actual number of crashes to the distribution, and ranks the intersections based on safety concern. The ISAM is the process that was developed to execute the UICPM. The first step is to prepare the model input by combining the roadway and crash data files. Crashes are assigned to intersections if they are located with the functional area of an intersection. The second step is to execute the UICPM using the R graphical user interface (GUI) tool and R software.

In addition, LCC reduces the settlement of the underlying soils which is attractive to engineers. To evaluate the passive force-deflection curves for these materials, large-scale lab tests were performed with LCC and CLSM backfills in addition to a granular backfill for comparison. The response of the LCC was similar to that of the granular backfill with somewhat higher peak force developing at about 2.5% of the wall height. Although the stiffness was about twice as high as the granular backfill, the post-peak reduction was less than that for the granular fill. In contrast, the CLSM had a stiffness about 10 times higher than the granular fill and reached the peak value at a deflection equal to 1% of the wall height. The CLSM experienced a rapid decease in strength of about 60% after the peak strength was reached. The ductility of the LCC makes it a more suitable material for seismic loading with higher displacement demands. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784482087.011

Responses indicate that participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-offs, with most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about threats from hackers or government surveillance. There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge.

To better understand users' perceptions of their digital lives and how they managed their online security posture, we conducted a series of 23 semi-structured interviews with mostly middle-aged parents from suburban Washington state. Using a grounded theory methodology, we analyzed the interview data and found that participants chose their security posture based on the immense value the Internet provides and their belief that no combination of technology could make them perfectly safe. Within this context, users have a four-stage process for determining which security measures to adopt: learning, evaluation of risks, estimation of impact, and weighing trade-offs to various coping strategies. Our results also revealed that a majority of participants understand the basic principles of symmetric encryption. We found that participants' misconceptions related to browser-based TLS indicators lead to insecure behavior, and it is the permanence of encrypted email that causes participants to doubt that it is secure. We conclude with a discussion of possible responses to this research and avenues for future research. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.",

Keeping sponsors happy is important to these programs in order to ensure continued support from these industry representatives, so finding ways to improve project outcomes is critical. In order to find blind spots that students may have been left with after their first 6-7 weeks of instruction, we conducted structured interviews with students in capstone programs at Brigham Young University and the US Air Force Academy. These interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes that may have been well understood or misunderstood by students. We found that a significant number of students had not understood concepts such as a design being more than a prototype, that sponsors have expectations for the tradeoffs between product cost and performance, or that they need to be thinking about how their designs might be deployed. It was also interesting to note that most students also reported feeling confident in their understanding despite their apparent lack thereof, indicating that these could represent major blind spots for students. We propose that developing methods for teaching these principles early on will help students see more clearly what their end goals need to be, and thus help them be more successful in delivering desirable designs.

They also tend to be the most unstructured portion of the project, and are often marginalized by teams who assume they already understand stakeholder needs and the best solution paths to pursue. Design researchers have developed methods shown to increase the creativity and divergent thinking of the design team during these initial phases of design. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on only a vague or amorphous representation of the design space (the set of all possible concepts the design team could feasibly select to meet the objective of the project). In this paper, we introduce a particular design-space structure that can help teams ideate and evaluate their ideation, thus improving the early phases of the design process. The design space presented here is a vector space with a basis of technology (the physical product people will use) and tactics (the procedure for using the product). Also presented are definitions, principles, and sub-theories that facilitate the creation and use of technology-tactics plots to represent the design space. Considering the design space in this structured way, the design team can gain valuable insights that improve the effectiveness of the initial stages of design, and may yield additional benefits to the design process as a whole, if further developed.

The gas-solid flow and pulverized coal combustion processes in an industrial precalciner were numerically modeled to understand the flow patterns and thermal processes in the system. The gas and meal flow rates and properties were measured on-site to determine the boundary conditions for the simulations and to validate the models. The upward swirl of the gas flow in the furnace helped disperse the particles and extend their duration in the precalciner. The O2 and CO2 concentration distributions indicated that the coal particles were well dispersed and fully combusted. The calculations showed that the precalciner outlet temperature was too high which reduces the thermal efficiency and may damage the preheater installed just after the precalciner. Finally, an optimized precalciner was proposed to improve the temperature distribution.

The existing field of multiobjective optimization offers a natural framework to define and explore a given design space. In this paper, a method for defining a product's sustainability space (defined by economic, environmental, and social sustainability objectives) is outlined and used to explore the tradeoffs within the space, thus offering both the design team and the decision makers a means of better understanding the sustainability tradeoffs. This paper concludes that sustainable product development can indeed benefit from tradeoff characterization using multiobjective optimization techniques - even when using only basic models of sustainability. Interestingly, the unique characteristics of the three essential sustainable development areas lead to an alternative view of some traditional multiobjective optimization concepts, such as weak-Pareto optimality. The sustainable redesign of a machine to drill boreholes for water wells is presented as a practical example for method demonstration and discussion.

Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths. The layer is also patternable to sizes as small as a few microns with high resolution. Conclusion: By combining a metal layer and a layer of nanoparticles in photoresist, a simple, cheap, and effective light-blocking antireflective layer can be created that is compatible with planar devices with complex topography. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",10.1117/1.JMM.18.1.015501

Both pseudo-probabilistic and probabilistic (i.e., performance-based) methods are assessed and compared. Results of the comparative study suggest that pseudo-probabilistic methods can significantly overestimate liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity. Performance-based probabilistic methods are shown to predict between 5.2 cm and 16.5 cm (approximately 36–47%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods in areas of low seismicity at a return period of 2475 years, and to predict 9 cm to 19.7cm (approximately 96%) less post-liquefaction free-field settlement on average than pseudo-probabilistic methods at a return period of 475 years. Soil site classification is shown to have substantial impact on the estimated liquefaction hazards in areas of low seismicity due to soil amplification, potentially increasing design accelerations by up to 56%. Consequences of inconsistencies regarding design ground motions in current seismic design provisions are also discussed. To avoid potential for overpredicting liquefaction hazards, engineers should apply a performance-based approach when assessing liquefaction triggering and its effects in areas of low to moderate seismicity. © 2018 The Authors",10.1016/j.soildyn.2018.10.040

Applying TMR to the design successfully reduces the design's neutron cross section by 80×. The effectiveness of TMR, however, is limited by the presence of single bits in the configuration memory which cause more than one TMR domain to fail simultaneously. We present three strategies to mitigate against these failures and improve the effectiveness of TMR: incremental routing, incremental placement, and striping. These techniques were tested using both fault injection and a wide spectrum neutron beam with the best technique offering a 400× reduction to the design's sensitive neutron cross section. An analysis from the radiation test shows that no single bits caused failure and that multicell upsets were the main cause of failure for these mitigation strategies. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TNS.2018.2877579

By measuring the pump-probe traces while ramping the pump intensity, we observed a clear change in the ultrafast pump-probe dynamics after the phase change. Correlation between the ultrafast dynamics in the femtosecond timescale and the amount of phase change observed in millisecond timescale indicates that accumulation of the excited states in the sample plays an important role in the acceleration of the phase change. The result clearly demonstrates the usefulness of our method, which could be applied to the investigation of multi-timescale dynamics in various irreversible phenomena.

11a5bdad-34c4-43f3-b51d-a2a0ac062775,Accelerating high-throughput searches for new alloys with active learning of interatomic potentials,2019,"We propose an approach to materials prediction that uses a machine-learning interatomic potential to approximate quantum-mechanical energies and an active learning algorithm for the automatic selection of an optimal training dataset. Our approach significantly reduces the amount of density functional theory (DFT) calculations needed, resorting to DFT only to produce the training data, while structural optimization is performed using the interatomic potentials. Our approach is not limited to one (or a small number of) lattice types (as is the case for cluster expansion, for example) and can predict structures with lattice types not present in the training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by predicting the convex hull for the following three systems: Cu-Pd, Co-Nb-V, and Al-Ni-Ti. Our method is three to four orders of magnitude faster than conventional high-throughput DFT calculations and explores a wider range of materials space. In all three systems, we found unreported stable structures compared to the AFLOW database. Because our method is much cheaper and explores much more of materials space than high-throughput methods or cluster expansion, and because our interatomic potentials have a systematically improvable accuracy compared to empirical potentials such as embedded atom model, it will have a significant impact in the discovery of new alloy phases, particularly those with three or more components. © 2018",10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.09.031

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This paper presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new class of arrays that are self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR), which are described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this paper presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance metrics of stiffness and shape. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Poorly defined scope of work has been ranked as the one of the highest reasons for poor performance over which owners and construction stakeholders have control. An owner's requirements and expectations are specified during the programming phase of a project and these define a design's scope of work. One focus of Target Value Design (TVD) is making owner's value a primary driver of design by improving project definition during programming-thus optimizing the design phase. While the number of published research articles praising TVD has been increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding the application of architectural programming (AP) to Target Value Design exercises, which engage stakeholders in a design decision making process called Choosing by Advantages (CBA). CBA first requires identification of attributes that are of value to an owner. The purpose of this research was to explore the importance of architectural programming in helping to identify key attributes of value to an owner, and to report on a lean game designed and preliminarily validated by the authors to investigate the accuracy and perception of attribute identification through AP as represented by the game. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

A three-way spectral decomposition quantifies the contribution from each noise type in the sound of a tied-down F-35B aircraft on a linear ground-based array spanning 35–152 deg. This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation.

This study investigates the apparent source locations of events related to crackle for a high-performance military jet aircraft using an event-based, time-domain beamforming method. This method utilizes the cross correlation between adjacent microphones to determine the angle of propagation of an ensemble of shock-related events within the time waveform. This angle of propagation is then traced back towards the source to find the apparent source location. Based on the angle of propagation, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone pairs along the array can be sorted into six groups. With increasing engine condition, groups related to the presence of crackle tend to shift downstream and broaden, in qualitative agreement with the general aeroacoustic source locations. However, a comparison with near-field acoustical holography shows that the apparent source region of crackle-related events appears upstream of the overall energy at intermediate power but appear to converge at maximum afterburner. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, measurements of full-scale, high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms. The field regions compare favorably to some spatiospectral lobe features observed in measurements of an F-35B aircraft operating at afterburner, though do not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

8ca01566-2f6a-454e-8f7c-00d0972b8aa5,The fog of warnings: How non-essential notifications blur with security warnings,2019,"Adherence to security warnings continues to be an important problem in information security. Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human-computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial. However, this problem has not been empirically examined before. This paper contributes by measuring the impacts of generalization in terms of (1) diminished attention via mouse cursor tracking and (2) users' ability to behaviorally adhere to security warnings. Through an online experiment, we find that: • Habituation to a frequent non-security-related notification does carry over to a one-time security warning. • Generalization of habituation is manifest both in (1) decreased attention to warnings and (2) lower warning adherence behavior. • The carry-over effect, most importantly, is due to generalization, and not fatigue. • The degree that generalization occurs depends on the similarity in look and feel between a notification and warning. These findings open new avenues of research and provide guidance to software developers for creating warnings that are more resistant to the effects of generalization of habituation, thereby improving users' security warning adherence. © is held by the author/owner.",

The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TÜBİTAK",10.3906/elk-1808-138

They are made possible by aligning hinge axes with developable surface ruling lines to enable mobility. Because rigid-link motion depends on the relative orientation of hinge axes and not link geometry, links can take the shape of the corresponding developable surface.

Thanks to their low-cost, low-power consumption, and flexibility, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are among the promising devices to implement neural networks. Unfortunately, FPGAs are also known to be susceptible to radiation-induced errors. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of radiation-induced errors in the output correctness of two neural networks [Iris Flower artificial neural network (ANN) and Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) convolutional neural network (CNN)] implemented in static random-access memory-based FPGAs. In particular, we notice that radiation can induce errors that modify the output of the network with or without affecting the neural network's functionality. We call the former critical errors and the latter tolerable errors. Through exhaustive fault injection, we identify the portions of Iris Flower ANN and MNIST CNN implementation on FPGAs that are more likely, once corrupted, to generate a critical or a tolerable error. Based on this analysis, we propose a selective hardening strategy that triplicates only the most vulnerable layers of the neural network.

At a future date, validation of this framework will be demonstrated using datasets from multiple disasters. The results will lead to recommendations on how the framework can be modified to make it applicable as a generic disaster-type characterization tool. © 2019 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

On a wettable horizontal surface, where a sufficient downstream liquid depth can be sustained after axisymmetric impingement, the jet forms a thin film on the substrate up to a radial distance where the film height suddenly increases, forming a hydraulic jump. On a superhydrophobic surface, where a downstream liquid depth is not naturally sustained, the thin film expands and breaks up into droplets, which are subsequently ejected in a random fashion outward, as carried by their radial momentum. In the present work, a facile, scalable, wettability-patterning approach is presented for delaying or even eliminating droplet breakup in the case of jet impingement on horizontal superhydrophobic surfaces. Analytical expressions for predicting the hydraulic jump and droplet breakup locations are developed to designate the proper wettability patterns that facilitate alteration and control of the postimpingement liquid behavior. The axisymmetric model is extended to evaluate the radial variation of the competing forces responsible for film breakup, and a design criterion for the effective wettability patterns is proposed. © 2019 American Physical Society.",10.1103/PhysRevFluids.4.014002
8132fe26-cefc-4dfd-8601-de20827abab3,Folding approaches for tensioned precision planar shell structures,2019,"An origami-based engineering approach is applied to the folding design of tensioned precision space structures. Tension is a viable means of stiffening a flat antenna aperture, especially when stowed volume is paramount. Three folding patterns are described, and the design guidelines are developed. Deployment kinematics follow the simplicity of a single-degree-of-freedom mechanism for two of the three patterns. The panels are rigid, and articulations occur along the prescribed lines. These deployment architectures are compatible with storable tubular extendible member booms, articulated trusses, or continuous longeron coilable trusses, all commonly used to deploy spacecraft structures. High areal packaging densities were demonstrated: 1.0 m2∕l for a diamond pattern with a high deployed aspect ratio and 0.5 m2∕l for spiral and serpentine patterns compatible with high and low deployed aspect ratios. A double-layer material hinge method is also presented and used to enable the structures to fold, deploy, and be tensioned to a planar state.

The M8.1 1985 subduction zone earthquake, which caused significant damage and loss of thousands of lives at 350 km epicentral distance, has become the quintessential example of the role that site effects can play in modifying the amplitude, frequency, and duration of ground shaking; and in aggravating the catastrophic consequences of earthquakes. We here present observations and analyses of the M7.1 September 19, 2017, event that -while triggered by an intraplate rupture at approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City -caused severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone. We show that the M 7.1 mainshock exposed the vulnerabilities of the pre-1985 building code in the transition zone; but more importantly highlighted the improvement of the 1987 building code revision in terms of the performance of modern high-rise buildings that suffered catastrophic consequences during the 1985 Michoácan earthquake sequence. We next analyze several records collected at stations in the basin over the past 20 years. We highlight the importance of three-dimensional heterogeneity of the basin sediments, the coupling between hydrological setting and site response and their evolution with time, and the energy interaction between the deep basin edge and the shallow clay layers.

However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements. The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts. The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started. Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature. Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles. Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP). The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models. The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a ""theory"" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models. In May 2018 at ""The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems,"" the keynote question was, ""Is it time to start using open source models?"" The answer is ""yes"". Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible. An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.

(2015) as a prelude to the release of the 2018 Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) developed by the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG). The focus of this study is the exploration of the south polar region of the Moon, a region that has not been visited by any human missions, yet exhibits a multitude of scientifically important locations – the investigation of which will address long standing questions in lunar research. This DRM architecture involves five landing sites (Malapert massif, South Pole/Shackleton crater, Schrödinger basin, Antoniadi crater, and the South Pole-Aitken basin center), to be visited in sequential years by crew, beginning in 2028. Two Lunar Electric Rovers (LER) are proposed to be tele-robotically operated between sites to rendez-vous with crew at the time of the next landing. With engineering parameters in mind we explore the feasibility of tele-robotic operation of these LERs between lunar landing sites, and identify potential high interest sampling locations en-route. Additionally, in-depth sample collection and return traverses are identified for each individual landing site across key geologic terrains that also detail crew Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA).

Power system models have a number of features that makes their improvement challenging - they are multi-level, multi-user and multi-physics. Not surprisingly, they are nonlinear and time varying, both in terms of states (memory variables) and parameters, and discrete structures, such as graphs, are strongly blended with continuous dynamics, resulting in network dynamics. The transient stability models are used as a prototypical example. Our method is based on information geometry, and uses advances in computational differential geometry to characterize high-dimensional manifolds in the space of measurements.

af27bec7-8321-4446-b9a6-d4653724b493,Evaluating Safety Impacts of Access Management Alternatives with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model,2018,"In a traditional safety impact analysis, it is necessary to have crash data on existing roadway conditions and a few years must pass before accumulating additional crash data to evaluate the safety impact of an improvement. This is a time-consuming approach and there remains uncertainty in the crash data integrity. The surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) was developed for resolving these issues. With SSAM, a conflict analysis is performed in a simulated environment. A planned improvement alternative is modeled and no physical installation of the alternative is needed. This study evaluated if SSAM can be used to assess the safety of a highway segment in terms of the number and type of conflicts and to compare the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. An evaluation of the effect of converting a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) into a raised median on a section of an urban street was performed using SSAM working on VISSIM simulation’s trajectory files. The analysis showed that a raised median would be much safer than a TWLTL median for the same level of traffic volume, with approximately 32 to 50 percent reduction in the number of crossing conflicts. The analysis showed that about 34,000 to 38,000 veh/day would be the demand level where the median conversion is recommended for the four-lane study section. The study concluded that the combination of a simulation software program with SSAM could be a viable surrogate analysis approach for evaluating and comparing the safety effects of multiple access management alternatives. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.",10.1177/0361198118773505

The surface microstructures were geometrically defined by cavity fraction (the ratio of projected cavity area to surface area), pitch (the center to center distance between microfeatures), and feature height. Surface heat flux and surface superheat, the difference between the heated surface and the pool saturation temperature, were measured for each surface. Ten different micropatterned surfaces with post or rib geometries were considered with cavity fraction varying from 0.5 to 0.98, pitch varying from 8 to 40 μm, and microfeature height at 4 μm or 15 μm. The surface heat flux was measured across a range of surface superheats spanning 2–38 K. It is demonstrated for the first time that the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling on rib patterned surfaces depends strongly on the cavity fraction. Increasing the microstructure height from 4 μm to 15 μm modestly increases the transition temperature. Nucleate boiling is more suppressed on post patterned surfaces than on rib patterned surfaces. Further, the rib structured surfaces exhibit a sudden transition from nucleate to film boiling while the post structured surfaces exhibit a gradual transition, with the vapor film growing slowly across the surface. Once stable film boiling is reached, the surface microstructure negligibly influences the heat flux for all surfaces. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.07.044

These dangerous countercurrents are known as submerged hydraulic jumps and are responsible for hundreds of fatalities at numerous low-head dams across the United States. The countercurrent creates high upstream-directed surface velocities across the width of the channel, making it nearly impossible for a trapped individual to escape. This submerged jump can occur for a range of upstream and downstream conditions. A multiple partial width deflector design for the downstream side of the dam was tested in the laboratory to determine effectiveness in completely or partially eliminating the submerged hydraulic jump. The results demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in upstream-directed surface velocities over a wide range of headwater and tailwater conditions is possible. The dam modification is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and designed such that an individual will likely escape the submerged jump without severe injury or harm.

Simulated evolution profiles for the U-16Pu-23Zr (at. pct) alloy show concentric zones that are compared with published experimental results; discrepancies in zone size are attributed to thermal profile differences and assumptions related to the diffusivity values used.

First-order slow equations are derived via the method of multiple time scales when the two small parameters are related by a rational power. We find that the resultant system depends only on the relationship of the two fast time scales, i.e. which fast time is fastest? Using the theory of cancellation of fast oscillations, we show that with the appropriate assumptions on the nonlinear operator of the full system, this reduced slow system is exactly that which the solution will converge to if each asymptotic limit is considered sequentially. The same result is also obtained via the method of renormalization.

In this study, the byproduct from coal power plant, coal fly ash (FA) was utilized as the support for Cu-based OC in methane CLC. Its performance was investigated with a thermogravimetric analyzer and a lab-scale fixed bed reactor. The results showed the FA is better as a support of OC than the most commonly used Al2O3 in anti-carbon deposition and thus beneficial to the importance of the stability of FA supported OCs. Among all the tested OCs, the Cu-based OC synthesized with FA support and impregnation method demonstrated the best performance, with CH4 conversion of 94–100% and CO2 selectivity of 91–94% in ten cycles at 800–850 °C, and minor deactivation. The characterization of the fresh and spent OCs revealed that the FA support itself could provide 1.0–2.9 wt% active oxygen for fuel combustion, which is enabled by the iron oxide in FA. In addition, the distribution of Cu on the FA support became more uniform on spent OC than on the fresh one. Also, the partially irreversible CuO decomposition into Cu2O during cyclic tests was the main reason for the deactivation of OC. Thus, Use of FA as an OC support is conducive to both development of cost-effective CLC and an environmental-friendly utilization of waste FA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.029

The objective of this work is to investigate the Integrated Spectral Band Ratio (ISBR) method for measuring the temperature of combustion product gases surrounded by radiating walls or within a mixture of gas and particles. Five conditions in a multi-fuel reactor were investigated using an optical probe. A Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer provided detailed spectral measurements of hot gas and particle emissions at wavelengths of 1.69–2.15 μm, focusing on a spectral region where H2O is the dominant participating gas. These measurements were used to infer the gas temperature of the flows. It was found that the measurement path length needed to be at least 0.25 m in order to obtain a signal large enough to infer temperature accurately. For four of the five operating conditions tested, optically measured gas temperatures were found to be in good agreement with the average temperature along the measured path as taken with a suction pyrometer (aspirated thermocouple). For these four operating conditions the particle media were optically thin. Temperatures for the in-flame fine wood particle condition did not exhibit as good of agreement due to high particle loading causing optically thick zones along the line of sight. Modeling experiments showed that when particles and gasses are optically thin, the optical gas temperature measured with this technique will be near the arithmetic mean of the line of sight temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2018.06.026

Circular micropillars 4 μm in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 μm, 12 μm and 16 μm, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110°C&lt;Ts&lt;337°C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5–4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.05.068

From the work of von zur Gathen, it is known that one can take Cn=n4. On the other hand, a conjecture of Mullen, which asserts essentially that one can take Cn=n(n−2) has been shown to be false. In this paper, we use a precise version of Weil bound for the number of points of affine algebraic curves over finite fields to obtain a refinement of the result of von zur Gathen where n4 is replaced by a sharper bound. As a corollary, we show that Mullen's conjecture holds in the affirmative if n(n−2) is replaced by n2(n−2)2. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.ffa.2018.07.006

54d0282b-bfe3-409b-a8cc-a3eda1f08bda,Column axial load effects on the performance of skewed SMF RBS connections,2018,"The selection of an appropriate seismic steel system (braced frame, moment frame, shear wall, etc.) is often influenced by architectural considerations. Moment frame configurations offer the most architectural flexibility, but are somewhat limited by a lack of guidance in the AISC seismic provisions regarding the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connections. A recent study investigating laterally skewed moment frame connections indicates adequate seismic performance; however, it was observed that skewed connections increase the potential for column twist and column flange yielding. It is unclear how larger column axial loads present in medium-to-high-rise structures will affect the performance of skewed special moment frame connections. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special moment frame connections containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that for axial loads less than 50% of the column axial capacity, there is little effect on connection rotation capacity. Beam-skew angle is the main contributor to resulting column twist. With the exception of the deep column geometries that experienced local flange buckling at 50% ΦPn axial load, increased column axial loads have little effect on resulting column flange yielding in skewed RBS moment connections. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jcsr.2018.09.007

In XPS, photoelectrons are generated by irradiating a surface with x rays. As the importance and popularity of XPS have grown, it has drawn users without significant XPS experience, and incorrect and incomplete interpretations of XPS spectra regularly appear in the literature. This tutorial is designed as a tool to guide less experienced users in analyzing XPS survey spectra. Here, the authors examine a series of XPS survey spectra collected during the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 from trimethylaluminum and water precursors. Prior to this, brief explanations of XPS and ALD are presented. This tutorial is structured as a series of questions and answers that the interested reader may choose to engage in. The XPS spectra are scrutinized to extract information about the elements present in the film, the presence of contamination, and the nature of the film growth process. The questions and answers in this tutorial address important fundamental issues common to the interpretation of many XPS survey spectra in the context of ALD. © 2018 Author(s).",10.1116/1.5043297

The fluidic actuation can be accomplished using droplets that also act as bearings. While rotary droplet bearings have been previously demonstrated, this paper addresses the positioning accuracy of a droplet-based bearing consisting of a droplet between a moving plate and a stationary substrate with constrained wetting region under a normal load. Key wetting cases are analyzed using both closed form analytical approximations and numerical simulations. The vertical force and stiffness characteristics are analyzed in relation to the wetting boundaries of the supporting surface. Case studies of different wetting boundaries are presented and summarized. Design strategies are presented for maximizing load carrying capability and stiffness.

To achieve the target limits of carbon dioxide emission, set by national and international policies, carbon capture will play a key role. Modeling and optimization of various carbon capture technologies such as pre-combustion, oxy-fuel, and post-combustion, when integrated with coal-fired power plants, have been researched extensively in literature. Research on the integration of power generation with capture technologies regarding comparisons between the different schemes in response to dynamic inputs is lacking. This work provides a comparison between a low temperature carbon capture and a chemical absorption process in response to a dynamic electricity demand and price profile and in the presence of an intermittent wind power supply. The objective in this work is to meet the overall electricity demand of residential users and the carbon capture process while the total operating cost associated with the integrated system of power generation and carbon capture is minimized. This comparison includes scenarios with and without energy storage associated with each capture technology. It is observed that in both integrated systems, with and without energy storage, the overall electricity demanded by the capture process and residential users is supplied by a combination of coal and wind power. For the case without energy storage, the total operating cost and energy demand of the low temperature carbon capture, based on a similar amount of captured carbon dioxide, are 4.3% and 20.5% less than that of chemical absorption, respectively. For the scenario with energy storage, the low temperature carbon capture requires 32.34% less energy to capture similar amounts of carbon dioxide while incurring 9.09% less overall operational cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.098

Engineers typically neglect the block-out concrete in design, effectively treating block-out connections as exposed connections with pinned behavior. Quantifying the flexural strength and stiffness of block-out connections is helpful for determining moment demands on foundations and may lead to more economical connections at the base of steel moment frames. Eight experimental specimens (two-thirds scale) were subjected to lateral loads to investigate the effects of column size, block-out thickness, and load orientation on connection flexural strength and stiffness. The observed flexural strengths were 1.4–2.7 times greater than those calculated neglecting the block-out concrete, because the block-out concrete effectively thickened and expanded the column base plate. A simple method was developed that predicted the flexural strength of the block-out connections to within 10 percent. The effective flexural stiffness at the base of the columns that were tested could be reasonably estimated using a model that combines the theory of beams on elastic foundations with a base rotational spring. © 2018",10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.06.055

The VANTA-IDEs were functionalized with an antibody (Ab) specific to the human cancerous inhibitor PP2A (CIP2A)—an oncoprotein that is associated with a variety of malignancies such as oral, breast, and multiple myeloma cancers. The resultant label-free immunosensor was capable of detecting CIP2A across a wide linear sensing range (1−100 pg/mL) with a detection limit of 0.24 pg/mL within saliva supernatant—a range that is more sensitive than the corresponding CIP2A enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

It is well known, however, that in practice there is no such thing as a universal compression algorithm; thus, some statistical information about the plaintext tends to survive the compression process. In this paper, we consider Lempel-Ziv Welch compression and analyze its effectiveness in removing statistical information from English plaintext. Specifically, we present several techniques for exploiting the structure of the compression algorithm to launch a successful statistical attack on compressed and encrypted data. All attacks are ciphertext only, and one of them relies on linear programming. Although our attacks indicate that an eavesdropper may require additional ciphertext to carry out a successful attack if compression is used, the specific adaptive nature of the Lempel-Ziv compression technique leaves its own statistics on the message, which can be exploited by an attacker. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491196

Although regular grids are the natural choice and easy to generate, more general grids whose generating vectors are not merely integer divisions of the reciprocal lattice vectors, are usually more efficient (Wisesa et al., 2016). We demonstrate the efficiency of generalized regular (GR) grids compared to Monkhorst-Pack (MP) and simultaneously commensurate (SC) grids. In the case of metals, for total energy accuracies of one meV/atom, GR grids are 60% faster on average than MP grids and 20% faster than SC grids.

Vessel operation in water environments can be enhanced by routing algorithms that integrate mission parameters with environmental data and vessel specifications. These algorithms must update predetermined routes in a timely manner as parameters and specifications change. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is developing the capability for military planners to rapidly optimize vessel routes in water environments by extending capabilities of the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support (ROAMS) modeling platform. The ROAMS platform allows users to rapidly generate models of a water environment in limited-information conditions, utilizing the Adaptive Hydraulics and STeady-state spectral WAVE computational engines for the base two-dimensional hydrodynamics and waves, respectively. Routing capabilities are built on path search and penalty-barrier optimization to automatically produce routes that account for temporally changing environmental variables and vessel maneuverability.

First, a dynamic stiffness matrix of the flexible beam is deduced, which has the same definition and a similar form as the traditional static compliance/stiffness matrix but is frequency dependent. Second, the pseudo-static modeling procedure for the dynamic analysis is implemented in a statics-similar way based on D'alembert's principle. Then, all the kinematic, static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms can be analyzed based on the pseudo-static model. The superiority of the proposed method is that when it is used for the dynamic modeling of compliant mechanisms, the traditional dynamic modeling procedures, such as calculation of the elastic and kinetic energies as well as using Lagrange's equation, are avoided and the dynamic modeling is converted to a staticssimilar problem.

In-plane uniaxial tension testing was performed in a standard test frame, while limiting dome height tooling was employed for out-of-plane biaxial and plane strain tension experiments. Sheet specimens were tested incrementally for each strain path, and the RA content at each level of strain was measured using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The biaxial tension strain path resulted in the greatest effective strain prior to necking at 0.355, compared to 0.123 for plane strain and 0.142 for uniaxial tension. EBSD measurements for various levels of plastic strain reveal a clear dependence of RA rate of transformation on strain path for the three linear strain paths that were employed in this work. Thinning strains appear to provide a slightly better correlation to RA transformation than effective strain levels, where biaxial tension achieved the greatest level just prior to necking, followed by plane-strain tension, and then uniaxial tension. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2018.07.062

The extent of the cavity effect is quantified using apparent absorptivity and apparent emissivity. Analysis of complicated thermal systems is simplified through application of apparent radiative properties to cavity geometries. The apparent radiative properties of a specularly-reflecting, gray, isothermal V-groove have been derived analytically, but these results have not been validated experimentally or numerically. Additionally, the model for apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subjected to partial illumination in the presence of collimated irradiation is not available. In this work, the following existing models for a specularly-reflecting V-groove are collected into a single source: (1) the apparent absorptivity of a diffusely irradiated V-groove, (2) the apparent emissivity of an isothermal V-groove and (3) the apparent absorptivity of a V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with full-illumination. Further, a new analytical model is developed to predict the apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with partial-illumination. A custom, Monte Carlo ray tracing solver is used to predict the apparent radiative properties for all cases as a means of numerical verification by comparing the ray tracing data with the results from the new model in this work and the previously existing models. For diffuse irradiation, the analytical model and ray tracing data show excellent agreement with an average discrepancy of 4.4 × 10−4, verifying the diffuse-irradiation analytical model. Similar agreement is found for collimated irradiation, where the full and partial illumination models indicate average discrepancies of 4.9 × 10−4 and 4.6 × 10−4 when compared with ray tracing data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.03.041

The CNT seeds were extended using ethylene as the gas precursor. Forces generated by CNT growth separated the alumina support clusters to result in a porous entangled structure with a 60 times gain in weight and a 1300 times gain in volume, compared to the original alumina particles. Effects of ferrocene injection rate, alumina particle sizes, and CNT growth parameters on the volume of the structure were analyzed and it was determined that high ferrocene input, moderate temperatures, and small alumina particles all favor the synthesis of high-volume CNT structures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.diamond.2018.07.022

After successful validation through available centrifuge test results, a series of parametric study has been carried out investigating the influence of various geometrical and geotechnical parameters of the foundation and the soils respectively. It is observed that the pile length and the pile diameter has significant effect on the natural radial frequency of the foundation system whereas soil density and spacing between piles have minimal effect. The importance of stiffness of the superstructure is also considered in the proposed methodology. It is found that the natural radial frequency of piled raft foundation including superstructure stiffness decreases by 12% to 28% when compared with the computation of the natural radial frequency excluding effect of superstructure stiffness.

In this paper, vehicle search paths are dictated by a joint cost function which maximizes the reward earned from partitioned sections across the search area. In previous work, these rewards were assigned based on the elapsed time since the section had last been searched. This approach is effective in rewarding vehicles to search out areas which haven't been visited in a long time, yet it lacks the ability to weight grid cells differently based on the probability that targets will be in that section. This paper proposes a method of using accumulated knowledge of the average density of targets within an area, along with a Gaussian process regression to assign rewards. Vehicles then choose paths that are more likely to find targets rather than seeking areas which have not been searched recently. Through numerical simulations we show that this method increases the number of targets seen by cooperating UAVs and provides an accurate estimate of target density within a search area. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/ICUAS.2018.8453323

For a given case, the effective modulus of elasticity is shown to decrease by about three orders of magnitude while the effective resilience decreases by approximately one order of magnitude. Designers can use this information to tailor materials to fit design requirements or to select alternative materials that were previously unsuited for an application. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/REMAR.2018.8449881
110a77a6-eed3-4b5d-a48e-dca5b10089cd,An Origami-based Thickness-Accommodating Bistable Mechanism in Monolithic Thick-sheet Materials,2018,"Origami-based mechanisms can provide useful capabilities in folding large structures to stow in small volumes. However, when using monolithic thick-sheet materials for these types of mechanisms, accommodating the thickness proves challenging. One approach to solve this is to create compliant mechanisms along the fold lines that inherently store energy when actuated and causes the mechanism to tend toward its low energy state. This tendency can be used to create bistable states. We outline a method to use this stored energy to achieve bistable states and name the resulting mechanism an origami-based ""Thickness-accommodating bistable interior vertex"" (TABIV) in monolithic thick-sheet materials. The kinematics and energy-displacement relationships of this mechanism are derived. Prototypes are shown to exhibit the predicted bistable behavior and the mechanism is integrated and prototyped into origami-based mechanisms demonstrating advantageous multi-stable behaviors. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/REMAR.2018.8449875

One of these new methods involves researchers creating random peptides and testing their antimicrobial activity. Developing antibiotics from these peptides requires understanding which sequence motifs will be toxic to bacteria. To determine if the toxic peptides of a randomly-generated peptide library can be uniquely classified based solely on sequence motifs, we created the PepSeq Pipeline: a new software that utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to extract motifs from a peptide library. We found that this pipeline can accurately classify 56% of the toxic peptides in the peptide library using motifs extracted from the model. Testing on simulated data with less noise, we could classify up to 94% of the toxic peptides. The pipeline extracted significant toxic motifs in every library that was tested, but its ability to classify all toxic peptides depended on the number of motifs in the library. Once extracted, these motifs can be used both to understand the biology behind why certain peptides are toxic and to create novel antibiotics.

For streaming movie services like Netflix, recommendation systems are essential for helping users find new movies to enjoy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach based on autoencoders to produce a collaborative filtering system which predicts movie ratings for a user based on a large database of ratings from other users. Using the MovieLens dataset, we explore the use of deep learning to predict users' ratings on new movies, thereby enabling movie recommendations. To verify the novelty and accuracy of our deep learning approach, we compare our approach to standard collaborative filtering techniques: k-nearest-neighbor and matrix-factorization.

c660eb4d-cf03-4c12-917e-35d003571ded,One-dimensional turbulence modeling for cylindrical and spherical flows: model formulation and application,2018,"The one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model resolves a full range of time and length scales and is computationally efficient. ODT has been applied to a wide range of complex multi-scale flows, such as turbulent combustion. Previous ODT comparisons to experimental data have focused mainly on planar flows. Applications to cylindrical flows, such as round jets, have been based on rough analogies, e.g., by exploiting the fortuitous consistency of the similarity scalings of temporally developing planar jets and spatially developing round jets. To obtain a more systematic treatment, a new formulation of the ODT model in cylindrical and spherical coordinates is presented here. The model is written in terms of a geometric factor so that planar, cylindrical, and spherical configurations are represented in the same way. Temporal and spatial versions of the model are presented. A Lagrangian finite-volume implementation is used with a dynamically adaptive mesh. The adaptive mesh facilitates the implementation of cylindrical and spherical versions of the triplet map, which is used to model turbulent advection (eddy events) in the one-dimensional flow coordinate. In cylindrical and spherical coordinates, geometric stretching of the three triplet map images occurs due to the radial dependence of volume, with the stretching being strongest near the centerline. Two triplet map variants, TMA and TMB, are presented. In TMA, the three map images have the same volume, but different radial segment lengths. In TMB, the three map images have the same radial segment lengths, but different segment volumes. Cylindrical results are presented for temporal pipe flow, a spatial nonreacting jet, and a spatial nonreacting jet flame. These results compare very well to direct numerical simulation for the pipe flow, and to experimental data for the jets. The nonreacting jet treatment overpredicts velocity fluctuations near the centerline, due to the geometric stretching of the triplet maps and its effect on the eddy event rate distribution. TMB performs better than TMA. A hybrid planar-TMB (PTMB) approach is also presented, which further improves the results. TMA, TMB, and PTMB are nearly identical in the pipe flow where the key dynamics occur near the wall away from the centerline. The jet flame illustrates effects of variable density and viscosity, including dilatational effects. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00162-018-0465-1

One issue with these codes is that they require knowledge of channel state information (CSI) for both the friendly party and the eavesdropper in the wiretap channel prior to constructing the code. In this paper, we present a framework for rateless physical-layer security codes over the wiretap channel by introducing both fixed and adaptive variants of rateless security coding schemes. These techniques can be used to reduce the requirements on CSI prior to code construction, because the codes will either adapt to the operating parameters of the legitimate user's channel on the fly and/or target a maximum allowable probability of intercept (POI) at the eavesdropper. All channels in play are packet erasure channels (PECs), as these channels are quite pervasive in most real-world network applications.

0530a156-70ba-46d2-bcf4-1b9401ac556b,Nested QPSK Encoding for Information Theoretic Security,2018,This paper proposes a method to provide secrecy for digital communications with arbitrarily large quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations for transmission over a Gaussian fading wiretap channel. This is accomplished by breaking the constellation down into nested quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) symbols and randomizing the assignment between message bits and modulated symbols using channel state information (CSI). If enough random bits can be generated from CSI it becomes possible to uniquely map an arbitrary message to any symbol in the large QAM constellation. The proposed method can thereby provide perfect secrecy while maintaining high reliability by exclusively assigning minimum-distance-mapped constellations through the randomization for use by the legitimate decoder. © 2018 IEEE.,10.1109/ICC.2018.8422678

Recently, there has been increased interest in Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys-small hardware devices that require users to press a button on the security key to authenticate.

The first study tasked 31 participants with configuring a Windows, Google, and Facebook account to authenticate using a YubiKey. This study revealed problems with setup instructions and workflow including users locking themselves out of their operating system or thinking they had successfully enabled 2FA when they had not. In contrast, the second study had 25 participants use a YubiKey in their daily lives over a period of four weeks, revealing that participants generally enjoyed the experience. Conducting both a laboratory and longitudinal study yielded insights into the usability of security keys that would not have been evident from either study in isolation.

The system embeds the CMOS image sensor directly in a PDMS layer instead of the standard chip package to support microfluidic structures much larger and more complex than those in prior art. The CMOS/PDMS layer is self-aligned to form a continuous, flat surface to provide structural support for upper microfluidic layers. The system consists of five layers of PDMS implementing fluid channels, valves, chambers, and inlets/outlets. A custom CMOS image sensor with integrated signal conditioning circuits directly captures light from sample fluid for high optical collection efficiency. Owing to the flexibility afforded by the integration process, the system demonstrates, for the first time, integrated valves in contact imaging. Moreover, we present the first direct comparison of the optical performance of a CMOS image sensor and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) in identical contact-imaging conditions. Measurements show that our CMOS sensor achieves 17 dB better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with a commercial PMT across a broad range of integration times, with a maximum SNR of 47 dB.

Named equations tested include the Meyer-Peter Muller, Barry, Pagosa good condition, Wilcock, Parker (both calibrated and uncalibrated), Recking, and that of Elhakeem and Imran. The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the performance of several empirical and semiempirical formulae using a single calibration point relative to three uncalibrated equations. The seven equations were included because they either have a calibration procedure already developed, are used frequently in practice, are historically foundational in the field, or have recently been proposed. Results are expressed in the root mean square error of the logarithms (RMSEL) and the relative mean error (RME) and show that the Pagosa good and Barry equations best predict bedload sediment transport (RMSEL of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). The Pagosa good equation requires a data point for bankfull discharge and the corresponding bedload transport. The uncalibrated Recking (2013) equation resulted in lower errors than two of the calibrated formulae (Wilcock 2001 and Parker 1990) and was not far behind the calibrated Elhakeem and Imran (2016) formula. The Meyer-Peter Muller and uncalibrated Parker (1990) equations performed the worst (RMSEL of up to 0.85 and 0.86, respectively). The results herein demonstrate: (1) empirical formulae were more successful at predicting bedload transport than semiempirical alternatives, (2) a single calibration point significantly improves the predictive accuracy of any formula, and (3) calibration cannot compensate for all the shortcomings of a model. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001474
5d151d8c-4201-4960-a5ab-70e9e8d66c4b,A Multimodal Exploration of Engineering Students' Emotions and Electrodermal Activity in Design Activities,2018,"Background: This exploratory study uses multimodal approaches to explore undergraduate student engagement via topic emotions and electrodermal activity (EDA) in different engineering design method activities and with different instructional delivery formats (e.g., lecture vs. active learning). Purpose/Hypothesis: The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how students respond, via engagement, to their engineering design activities during class. This study hypothesizes that students would experience no self-reported mean changes in topic emotions from their preassessment scores for each engineering design topic and instructional format nor would electrodermal activities (EDA) associate to these topic emotions throughout the design activities. Design/Method: Eighty-eight freshmen engineering students completed online pretopic and posttopic emotions surveys for five engineering design activities. A subset of 14–18 participants, the focal point of this study, wore an EDA sensor while completing the surveys and participating in these sessions. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that EDA increased for individual and collaborative active learning activities compared to lectures. No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest. At the end of the semester, active learning activities showed higher effect sizes indicating a re-enforcement of students' engagement in the engineering design method activities. Conclusion: This study provides initial results showing how multimodal approaches can help researchers understand students' closer-to-real-time engagement in engineering design topics and instructional delivery formats. © 2018 ASEE",10.1002/jee.20225

In this paper, a kinetostatic modeling method for flexure-hinge-based compliant mechanisms with hybrid serial-parallel substructures is presented to provide accurate and concise solutions by combining the matrix displacement method with the transfer matrix method. The transition between the elemental stiffness matrix and the transfer matrix of flexure hinges/flexible beams is straightforward, enabling the condensation of a hybrid serial-parallel substructure into one equivalent two-node element simple. A general kinetostatic model of the whole compliant mechanisms is first established based on the equilibrium equation of the nodal force. Then, a condensed two-port mechanical network representing the input/output force-displacement relations of single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) compliant mechanisms and the Jacobian matrix for multi-DOF compliant mechanisms are respectively built. Comparison of the proposed method with the compliance matrix method in previous literature, finite element analysis and experiment for three exemplary mechanisms reveals good prediction accuracy, suggesting its feasibility for fast performance evaluation and parameter optimization at the initial stage of design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2018.03.014

A major shortcoming of most commercially available 3D printers is that their resolution is not sufficient to produce features that are truly microfluidic (&lt; 100 × 100 μm2). Here, we test a custom 3D printer for making ~30 μm scale positive and negative surface features, as well as positive and negative features within internal voids (i.e., microfluidic channels). We found that optical dosage control is essential for creating the smallest microfluidic features (~30 μm wide for ridges, ~20 μm wide for trenches), and that this resolution was achieved for a number of different exposure approaches. Additionally, we printed various microfluidic particle traps, showed capture of 25 μm diameter polymer beads, and iteratively improved the trap design. The rapid feedback allowed by 3D printing, as well as the ability to carefully control optical exposure conditions, should lead to new innovations in the types and sizes of devices that can be created for microfluidics. © 2018 by the authors.",10.3390/mi9070326

Recent work has extended the crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite in steels to include the reconstruction of special boundaries, such as annealing twins. These reconstructions present unique challenges, as twinned austenite grains share a subset of possible daughter variant orientations. This gives rise to regions of ambiguity in a reconstruction. A technique for the reconstruction of twin boundaries is presented here that is capable of reconstructing 60° <1 1 1> twins, even in the case where twin regions are comprised entirely of variants that are common between the twin and the parent. This technique is demonstrated in the reconstruction of lath martensitic steels. The reconstruction method utilizes a delayed decision-making approach, where a chosen orientation relationship is used to define all possible groupings of daughter grains into possible parents before divisive decisions are made. These overlapping, inclusive groupings (called clusters) are compared to each other individually using their calculated parent austenite orientations and the topographical nature of the overlapping region. These comparisons are used to uncover possible locations of twin boundaries present in the parent austenite. This technique can be applied to future studies on the dependence of post-transformation microstructures on the special grain boundary content of parent microstructures. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

0894b7fb-ff75-4912-a256-535fc52512ef,Bézier B̄ projection,2018,"In this paper we demonstrate the use of Bézier projection to alleviate locking phenomena in structural mechanics applications of isogeometric analysis. Interpreting the well-known B̄ projection in two different ways we develop two formulations for locking problems in beams and nearly incompressible elastic solids. One formulation leads to a sparse symmetric system and the other leads to a sparse non-symmetric system. To demonstrate the utility of Bézier projection for both geometry and material locking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko beams and volumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the approach can be applied generally to other types of locking phenomena as well. Bézier projection is a local projection technique with optimal approximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are comparable to global L2 projection. In the context of B̄ methods, the use of Bézier projection produces sparse stiffness matrices with only a slight increase in bandwidth when compared to standard displacement-based methods. Of particular importance is that the approach is applicable to any spline representation that can be written in Bézier form like NURBS, T-splines, LR-splines, etc. We discuss in detail how to integrate this approach into an existing finite element framework with minimal disruption through the use of Bézier extraction operators and a newly introduced dual basis for the Bézier projection operator. We then demonstrate the behavior of the two proposed formulations through several challenging benchmark problems. © 2018",10.1016/j.cma.2018.02.019

This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes. Results from testing the proposed method in a high-fidelity simulation of the filter is also presented. © 2018 IEEE.",10.1109/PLANS.2018.8373454

After twin initiation, the twin boundary migrated toward the plastic-deformed grain interior to reduce the stored energy. Additionally, intergranular twin boundaries were ascribed to boundary growth stagnation. When boundary growth stagnation occurred, twin boundaries could form and altered the orientation of the boundary migration front, so that boundary migration could progress, leaving a single twin boundary behind. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.matchar.2018.03.035
9fbf08a4-7b08-4c87-9735-216608a21054,Bubble nucleation in superhydrophobic microchannels due to subcritical heating,2018,"This work experimentally studies the effects of single wall heating on laminar flow in a high-aspect ratio superhydrophobic microchannel. When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 μm and 366 μm are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.12.113
2410c808-64bc-4794-9994-01b89bbe29bc,Measuring User Perceptions of Popular Transportation Project Delivery Methods Using Least Significant Difference Intervals and Multiple Range Tests,2018,"One of the most critical decisions made by transportation project stakeholders is the choice of a project delivery method for their project. Delivery methods have been shown to significantly impact project cost and schedule. As the use of alternative project delivery methods increases, the perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages to using a particular method have matured. This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals. The analyses show that delivery method selection is motivated primarily by project urgency, cost, and risk allocation. For the three main delivery methods of DBB, CMAR, and DB, motivation for their selection is primarily based on cost, risk allocation, and project urgency, respectively. User perceptions align with findings from literature in terms of schedule performance, but do not align in terms of cost performance. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by reporting on the most current motivating factors for the selection and use of the most popular delivery methods. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001469

High fidelity, wavelength dependent multi-spot patterns from MMI waveguides are useful for sensitive and simultaneous identification of multiple targets in multiplexed fluorescence optofluidic biosensors. Through experiments and simulation, this paper explores design parameters for an MMI rib anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguide in order to produce high fidelity spot patterns at the liquid core biomarker excitation region. Width and etch depth of the single excitation rib waveguide used to excite the MMI waveguide are especially critical because they determine the size of the input optical mode which is imaged at the MMI waveguide's output. To increase optical throughput into the MMI waveguide when light is coupled in from an optical fiber, tapers in the waveguide width can be used for better mode matching. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/JQE.2018.2816120

Lamina emergent compliant mechanisms often exhibit undesirable parasitic motions due to the planar fabrication constraint. This work introduces a type of lamina emergent torsion (LET) joint that reduces parasitic motions of lamina emergent mechanisms, and presents equations for modeling parasitic motion of LET joints. The membrane joint also makes possible one-way joints that can ensure origami-based mechanisms emerge from their flat state (a change point) into the desired configuration. Membrane-enhanced LET (M-LET) joints, including one-way surrogate folds, are described here and show promise for use in a wide range of compliant mechanisms and origami-based compliant mechanisms. They are demonstrated as individual joints and in mechanisms such as a kaleidocycle (a 6R Bricard linkage), degree-4 origami vertices (spherical mechanisms), and waterbomb base mechanisms (an 8R multi-degrees-of-freedom origami-based mechanism). © 2018 by ASME.",10.1115/1.4039852
c6a0973b-61c5-4497-adcf-ab8f24585ef7,High-Strength Concrete Masonry Walls under Concentric and Eccentric Loadings,2018,"Masonry walls and columns are common structural members that typically resist compressive loads, with a number of such members being required to resist combined axial load and out-of-plane bending due to direct out-of-plane loads or an eccentricity of the axial compressive load. Flexural compression strength is usually greater than axial compression strength, and a reasonable experimental data set supports this assertion. However, little information exists for high-strength concrete block masonry subjected to combined axial and flexural loadings. This paper presents axial and flexural compression strengths and deformation properties of high-strength concrete block masonry. Seventy-two masonry prisms were constructed and tested to evaluate the capacity and behavior of high-strength structural masonry subject to compressive concentric and eccentric loading; both grouted and hollow prisms were used. Block strengths of 44, 56, and 67 MPa are considered. The results show an increase of flexural compression strength of 15-29% for the hollow prisms and of 70-79% for the grouted prisms compared with their axial compression strength. Measured ultimate strain varies from 0.14 to 0.19% for the axial compression and from 0.20 to 0.25% for the flexural compression. Hollow prism strength varies from 52 to 62% of the block strength, whereas grouted prism strength varies from 43 to 59% of the block strength. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001978

Poor sitting posture is regarded as an aggravating factor for various diseases. In this paper, we present an inverse piezoresistive nanocomposite sensor, and related deciphering neural network, as a new tool to identify human sitting postures accurately. As a low power consumption device, the proposed tool has simple structure, and is easy to use. The strain gauge is attached to the back of the user to acquire sitting data. A three-layer BP neural network is employed to distinguish normal sitting posture, slight hunchback and severe hunchback according to the acquired data. Experimental results show that our method is both realizable and effective, achieving 98.75% posture identification accuracy. This successful application of inverse piezoresistive nanocomposite sensors reveals that the method could potentially be used for monitoring of diverse physiological parameters in the future. © 2018 by the authors.

While most individuals recover fully from mild injuries within weeks, some continue to experience symptoms including headaches, disrupted sleep, and other cognitive, behavioral or physical symptoms. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) shows promise in identifying areas of structural disruption and predicting outcomes. Although some studies suggest widespread structural disruption after brain injury, dMRI studies of military brain injury have yielded mixed results so far, perhaps due to the subtlety of mild injury, individual differences in injury location, severity and mechanism, and co-morbidity with other disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. We present preliminary dMRI results from the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) military brain injury working group.

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of forefoot strike (FFS) and rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns on foot kinematics and kinetics, from the perspectives of the midtarsal locking theory and the windlass mechanism. Per the midtarsal locking theory, we hypothesized that the ankle would be more inverted in early stance when using a FFS, resulting in decreased midtarsal joint excursions and increased dynamic stiffness. Associated with a more engaged windlass mechanism, we hypothesized that a FFS would elicit increased metatarsophalangeal joint excursions and negative work in late stance. Eighteen healthy female runners ran overground with both FFS and RFS patterns. Instrumented motion capture and a validated multi-segment foot model were used to analyze midtarsal and metatarsophalangeal joint kinematics and kinetics. During early stance in FFS the ankle was more inverted, with concurrently decreased midtarsal eversion (p < 0.001) and abduction excursions (p = 0.003) but increased dorsiflexion excursion (p = 0.005). Dynamic midtarsal stiffness did not differ (p = 0.761). During late stance in FFS, metatarsophalangeal extension was increased (p = 0.009), with concurrently increased negative work (p < 0.001). In addition, there was simultaneously increased midtarsal positive work (p < 0.001), suggesting enhanced power transfer in FFS. Clear evidence for the presence of midtarsal locking was not observed in either strike pattern during running. However, the windlass mechanism appeared to be engaged to a greater extent during FFS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jbiomech.2018.04.010

Five different backing plate materials and a wide range of travel speeds and weld powers were used in the experimental design to ensure the models are relevant to a broad range of welding parameters. The resulting models have R-squared values of 0.997 and 0.995 for the dimensionless peak temperature rise and cooling rate correlations, respectively. Demonstrations of the models’ practical applications are provided. Herein is shown how the models can identify welding parameter (i.e. travel speed or power) levels needed to produce a desired weld peak temperature rise or cooling rate.

It is based on Bézier extraction and projection and is applicable to any spline space which can be represented in Bézier form (i.e., NURBS, T-splines, LR-splines, etc.). The approach weakly enforces the continuity of the solution at patch interfaces and the error can be adaptively controlled by leveraging the refineability of the underlying slave dual spline basis without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. As a consequence, optimal higher-order convergence rates can be achieved without the need for an expensive shared master/slave segmentation step. We also develop weakly continuous geometry as a particular application of isogeometric Bézier dual mortaring. Weakly continuous geometry is a geometry description where the weak continuity constraints are built into properly modified Bézier extraction operators. As a result, multi-patch models can be processed in a solver directly without having to employ a mortaring solution strategy. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several challenging benchmark problems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.cma.2018.01.023
835e19c0-7f49-4d19-b004-fd7a231a0e43,Effect of environmental and material factors on the response of nanocomposite foam impact sensors,2018,"Nanocomposite foam (NCF) is a multifunctional material that can be used to measure impact. Interactions between the flexible polymer matrix and conductive particles dispersed throughout it produce a voltage signal under dynamic strain, which correlates to the magnitude of impact. Though promising in applications requiring both impact sensing and energy absorption, NCF's voltage response has been observed to suffer from significant signal drift. This paper investigates several causes of variance in the response of NCF sensors to consistent impacts. These effects can be classified into three general types: recoverable transient effects (such as those relating to viscoelasticity or capacitive charging), environmental drift (due to humidity and temperature), and permanent signal decay from material degradation. The motivation for the study arises from various potential repeat-impact applications where periodic recalibration of the sensor would be difficult (such as a gait-tracking insole in use for a marathon event). A cyclic drop testing machine was used to apply consistent impacts to NCF, and drift resulting from each factor (in ranges typical of an insole environment) was experimentally isolated. Models representing each factor's contribution to signal drift are presented. Of the factors investigated, humidity and temperature caused the most significant drift, with permanent material degradation accounting for only minor decay in voltage response. Transient effects were also observed, with a characteristic 'warm-up' (or 'charging') time required for the NCF to achieve steady-state; this phenomenon, and the related 'recovery' time for the material to return to its original state, were determined. The resultant data can be leveraged to implement a correction algorithm or other drift-compensating method to retain an NCF sensor's accuracy in both long and short data collection scenarios. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1361-665X/aab7d7

Among materials used, bimetallic and trimetallic nickel catalysts have shown great promise. In this study, we report a 38% increase in the rate of ethylene production with the addition of Ce to NiNb catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was performed in the temperature range of 250-350 °C. At 300 °C, the rate of ethylene production was maximized with a rate of 6.91 × 10-4 mmol gcat-1 s-1. At higher temperatures, the rate of deep oxidation to CO2 outcompeted the rate of ethylene formation. The improved rate due to the addition of Ce is attributed to ceria's ability to rapidly transport oxygen to the NiO active sites. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00531
dbf3cf70-78c7-4c0b-9ee4-96078d547c46,Scalable fabric tactile sensor arrays for soft bodies,2018,"Soft robots have the potential to transform the way robots interact with their environment. This is due to their low inertia and inherent ability to more safely interact with the world without damaging themselves or the people around them. However, existing sensing for soft robots has at least partially limited their ability to control interactions with their environment. Tactile sensors could enable soft robots to sense interaction, but most tactile sensors are made from rigid substrates and are not well suited to applications for soft robots which can deform. In addition, the benefit of being able to cheaply manufacture soft robots may be lost if the tactile sensors that cover them are expensive and their resolution does not scale well for manufacturability. This paper discusses the development of a method to make affordable, high-resolution, tactile sensor arrays (manufactured in rows and columns) that can be used for sensorizing soft robots and other soft bodies. However, the construction results in a sensor array that exhibits significant amounts of cross-talk when two taxels in the same row are compressed. Using the same fabric-based tactile sensor array construction design, two different methods for cross-talk compensation are presented. The first uses a mathematical model to calculate a change in resistance of each taxel directly. The second method introduces additional simple circuit components that enable us to isolate each taxel electrically and relate voltage to force directly. Fabric sensor arrays are demonstrated for two different soft-bodied applications: an inflatable single link robot and a human wrist. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1361-6439/aab221

Today's highly complex designs require modern software tools and the realities of a global economy often constrain engineers to remote collaboration. These conditions make it highly impractical to collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D) information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware. This work demonstrates an immersive collaborative environment built using a network of this hardware, which allows users to interact with gestures virtually and conducts a study to show its advantages over traditional video conferencing software.

Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper, we introduce a potential universal metric, the product impact metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. By measuring impact multidimensionally, it captures impacts both anticipated and unanticipated, thereby providing a broader assessment of the product's total impact than with other more specific metrics. The PIM is calculated based on 18 simple field measurements of the consumer. It is inspired by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNMPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UNMPI measures how level of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's poverty level changes after being affected by an engineered product. The PIM can be used to measure social impact (using specific data from products introduced into the market) or predict social impact (using personas that represent real individuals).

To accommodate the local traffic needs of high accessibility and efficiency, an increased number of signalized intersections and accesses have been installed. However, the absence of a defined hierarchical road network, together with irregular signal spacing and access density, tends to deteriorate arterial safety. Previous studies on arterial safety were generally based on a single type of road entity, either intersection or roadway segment, and they analyzed the safety contributing factors (e.g. signal density and access density) on only that type of road entity, while these suburban arterial characteristics could significantly influence the safety performance of both intersections and roadway segments. Macro-level safety modeling was usually applied to investigate the relationships between zonal crash frequencies and demographics, road network features, and traffic characteristics, but the previous researchers did not consider the specific arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. In this study, a new modeling strategy was proposed to analyze the safety impacts of zonal roadway network features (i.e., road network patterns and road network density) along with the suburban arterial characteristics of signal density and access density. Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive Poisson Log-normal models were developed for suburban arterials in 173 traffic analysis zones in the suburban area of Shanghai. Results identified that the grid pattern road network with collector roads parallel to arterials was associated with fewer crashes than networks without parallel collectors. On the other hand, lower road network density, higher signal density and higher access density tended to increase the crash occurrence on suburban arterials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.aap.2018.01.029

The dataset used to create the prediction models includes physiological, exercise and questionnaire data related to individuals who performed the left-side bridge exercise and completed the Perceived Activity Rating (PAR) and Perceived Functional Ability (PFA) questionnaires. To evaluate the performance of the models, two well-known metrics, namely Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Multiple Correlation Coefficient (R) have been used, whereas the generalization errors have been assessed using 10-fold cross validation. The best prediction performance among the models has been obtained by using MFANN along with the predictor variables gender, age, body mass index (BMI), the times to reach a rate of perceived exertion values of 7 and 8 (RPE-7 and RPE-8, respectively) and PAR, producing the lowest RMSE and the highest R with 10.61 seconds (s) and 0.92, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/CICN.2017.8319387

They also argue that existing recommender systems operate fundamentally different for long tail products than for mainstream goods. While matrix factorization, nearest-neighbors, and clustering work well for the ""head"" market, the long tail is better represented by a graph; specifically a bipartite graph that connects a set of users to a set of goods. In this paper, we show the algorithms presented by Yin et al., as well as a set of similar algorithms proposed by Shang et al., which traverse the bipartite graphs through a random walker in order to identify similar users and products. We build on elements from each work, as well as elements from a Markov process, to facilitate the random walker's traversal of the graph into the long tail regions.

Because crystallographic texture is a universal characteristic of polycrystalline materials, this work has the potential to significantly expand the class of materials whose grain boundary networks can be controlled.

Little is known about the influence of the Coanda effect on wildland fire behavior. Specifically, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how the flame attachment on slopes influences firefighter safety zone considerations in rugged terrain. This paper presents results for small-scale n-heptane pool fire experiments near a slope, showing how flame shape and heat flux are influenced by slope angle, slope boundary condition and distance from flame base. Flames near slopes leaned toward the slope, and at some slope angles the flames attached to the slope. The average angle at which the effects of slope were noticeable was between 10° and 45°, depending on the criteria used. No difference was observed between a bare slope and an insulated slope. Dimensional analysis showed that important characteristics of flame attachment on slopes in the small-scale experiments were in the range estimated for the large fires. The implication is that the traditional view of safe separation distance as being the distance from the flame base is inadequate for fires near slopes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.01.002

These shallow 10-11 deep km events are the strongest earthquakes recorded in Kyushu prefecture during the modern instrumental era. The United States' National Science Foundation (US NSF) supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association conducted a reconnaissance of the region. These earthquakes resulted in substantial damage to infrastructure, buildings, cultural heritage of Kumamoto castle, roads and highways, slopes, and river embankments. Surface fault rupture produced offset to roads, buildings, river levees, and an agricultural dam. Surprisingly, given the extremely intense earthquake motions, liquefaction-induced damage was mostly limited to a few districts of Kumamoto City and in port areas, indicating that either the volcanic soils were largely unsusceptible to liquefaction or the presence of fines reduced the surficial manifestation of liquefaction and its effects. The important case histories identified by the study are [1] fault rupture through Oh-Kirihata Dam; [2] subsidence in Aso Caldera; [3] fault rupture through Shimojin-Cho River Canal; [4] surprising paucity of liquefaction and its effects; and [5] possible identification of a nearly non-displacement lateral spread.

For such small chips, an interconnection method is needed to provide the necessary world-to-chip reagent and pneumatic connections. In this paper, we introduce simple integrated microgaskets (SIMs) and controlled-compression integrated microgaskets (CCIMs) to connect a small device chip to a larger interface chip that implements world-to-chip connections. SIMs or CCIMs are directly 3D printed as part of the device chip, and therefore no additional materials or components are required to make the connection to the larger 3D printed interface chip. We demonstrate 121 chip-to-chip interconnections in an 11 × 11 array for both SIMs and CCIMs with an areal density of 53 interconnections per mm2 and show that they withstand fluid pressures of 50 psi. We further demonstrate their reusability by testing the devices 100 times without seal failure. Scaling experiments show that 20 × 20 interconnection arrays are feasible and that the CCIM areal density can be increased to 88 interconnections per mm2. We then show the utility of spatially distributed discrete CCIMs by using an interconnection chip with 28 chip-to-world interconnects to test 45 3D printed valves in a 9 × 5 array. Each valve is only 300 μm in diameter (the smallest yet reported for 3D printed valves). Every row of 5 valves is tested to at least 10000 actuations, with one row tested to 1-000000 actuations.

Using this screen, we also evaluated the predictive impact of PEGylation site solvent accessibility, conjugation site structure, PEG size, and double PEGylation. Our findings indicate that PEGylation efficiency, protein stability, and protein activity varied considerably with PEGylation site, variations that were not well predicted by common PEGylation guidelines.

Recent work has presented in-system debug frameworks where instrumentation added to the design collects trace data as the circuit runs, and a software tool that allows the user to replay the execution using the captured data. When searching for the root cause of a bug, the designer may need to modify the instrumentation to collect data from a new part of the design, requiring a lengthy recompile. In this paper, we propose a flexible debug overlay family that provides software-like debug turn-around times for HLS generated circuits. At compile time, the overlay is added to the design and compiled. At debug time, the overlay can be configured many times to implement specific debug scenarios without a recompilation. This paper first outlines a number of “capabilities” that such an overlay should have, and then describes architectural support for each of these capabilities. The cheapest overlay variant allows selective variable tracing with only a 1.7% increase in area overhead from the baseline debug instrumentation, while the deluxe variant offers 2x-7x improvement in trace buffer memory utilization with conditional buffer freeze support. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",10.1145/3174243.3174254

The identifiability conditions of the structured linear fractional transformation are then compared to those of the dynamical structure function, another partial system representation, whose cost for identification was detailed in previous work [1].

Since energy absorption is dependent upon the unique stress-strain response of each foam specimen, it is difficult to quantify analytically; thus, energy absorption cannot be easily compared across materials. Current methods accomplish this using an experimental approach, individually testing foam materials, densities, and geometries to quantify how each influences energy absorption. Such methods require large amounts of time and money to characterize a narrow range of foams. This paper facilitates foam selection by deriving generalized energy absorption material indices. Assuming Euler buckling of columns in the open-cell foam structure, this paper applies equations derived by Maiti et al. to a typical impact scenario wherein the indices are extracted. Using existing Ashby charts, these indices allow polymers to be ranked by the mass and cost each would require as a foamed structure to satisfy specific energy absorption constraints. The presented method allows the energy absorption of a wide range of flexible foams to be compared and relieves the need for extensive factor-specific testing. This method is applied to football helmet foam selection; however, it can be used for many applications where energy absorption is of interest. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.matdes.2017.10.054

The distribution of grain size, low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and twin boundaries throughout the joints were quantitatively analyzed. The weld power, axial load, and weld temperature were monitored. The grain structure evolution during friction welding was clarified. The grain structure in the recrystallization zone (RXZ) of the weld was a result of competition between dynamic recrystallization and grain boundary sliding (GBS), which is controlled by the local deformation condition. The axial force during welding decreased with reducing the rotation rate from 1000 rpm to 500 rpm. This anomalistic phenomenon can be ascribed that a decrease in rotation rate resulted in finer grain size in the RXZ of the weld, which required lower applied force to enable GBS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2017.10.092

This research applied and measured the impact of using surrogates to quickly model the stresses on a compressor blade. By modeling distinct points on a finite element (FE) model with unique surrogates, the stress field of the entire FE model was quickly predicted. This required that the distinct points remain in the same relative location on each blade used in training the surrogate. This research studied the ability of mesh morphing, and using the surface nodes as those distinct points, to satisfy this requirement. The results show that mesh morphing performed well on the tested compressor blades. The research also found that the surrogate accuracy depended not only on the number of training samples, but also the number and types of parameters being emulated. The surrogate models achieved less than 5% error on all the tested blades. Finally, the method provided a 96% decrease in time required for a structural iteration of a compressor blade. Such speeds eliminate bottlenecks that may occur in the structural design process. The combination of mesh morphing and surrogate modeling in compressor blade analysis enables exploration of various geometric parameters and their effect on structural responses. Application of this process would produce a more thoroughly refined and understood compressor blade design. Copyright © 2018 by ASME.",10.1115/GT201877188

However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Determining the end of primary consolidation is greatly exacerbated for layered soils that compress at varying rates. This paper discusses the use of magnet extensometer instrumentation to isolate compression within specific subsurface layers and associated techniques for estimating the time of construction induced settlement. Field data is used during construction to estimate the end of construction induced subsurface compression, which greatly affects the project schedule. This case study briefly summarizes instrumentation installation, data gathering, and the challenges associated with projecting the time of construction settlement. Two different curve fitting techniques were evaluated in this research: using standard primary consolidation equations and finite difference equations for estimating the end of primary consolidation settlement. For the site investigated, the curve fitting techniques proved to be somewhat problematic because the soil layers had small magnitudes of settlement and the transition between primary and secondary settlement was not readily apparent during the evaluation of real time field data. Using the finite difference equations also proved somewhat problematic trying to fit the full record of field data based on all of the different stages of loading. Additional lessons learned include the need for effective project communication between contractors, designers, and owners and a corresponding open discussion regarding practical settlement risk. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

No SR-HALE aircraft has yet accomplished this task due to the complex network of environmental, solar, structural, and aerodynamic trade-offs, among which aircraft exibility plays a key role. A comprehensive SR-HALE aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization framework is developed in which the exible aircraft analysis tool ASWING is incorporated in order to constrain nonlinear aeroelasticity. Energy, battery, ply thickness, material failure, local buckling, aerodynamic stall, longitudinal stability, and general stability (including utter) constraints are applied in order to reasonably constrain the optimized SR-HALE aircraft design. An SR-HALE aircraft design with a span length of 60:15m and a total aircraft weight of 432:2 kg is found which fulfills all SR-HALE mission requirements and minimizes aircraft mass. A further 21% reduction in total aircraft mass is found through the use of high modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer.

65c46693-3478-4b42-a6ea-0b4bf796f79b,Distributed electric propulsion effects on traditional aircraft through multidisciplinary optimization,2018,"Electric aircraft face a steep tradeoff between the demand for runway performance and range. While fuel based propulsion technologies typically increase in specific power with increasing size, electric propulsion is typically much more scalable. This system scalability enables alternative designs including distributed propulsion, optionally powered propulsion units, and vectored thrust, which can all contribute to better runway performance and range. In this paper, we explore how continuously powered distributed propulsion can reduce takeoff distance while still satisfying range constraints. We use a combination of a blade element momentum method, a vortex lattice method, experimental data, and nonlinear optimization techniques to model and explore the design space. We have found that for this conceptual design study, a fully blown wing with propellers at the optimal diameter for the load (8 propellers for a 300 km range constraint) can reduce the takeoff distance by over 80% when compared to the optimal 2 propeller case using the same models. There is over a 2x increase in the wing lift coefficient which leads to a 36% reduction in liftoff speed. Also, the optimal fully blown case produced 2.9 more thrust during takeoff with only an 11% increase in total aircraft mass. Using propeller tip speed as a surrogate for noise, we found that the propeller tip speed decreased takeoff performance in an exponential manner: the tip speed could be decreased from Mach 0.8 to Mach 0.5 with only a 2x increase in takeoff rolling distance while decreasing the constraint to Mach 0.3 produced an 8x increase. © 2018, (publisher Name).

Superdirective antennas are commonly considered as transmitters, but thinking of the antenna as a receiver may help to understand and overcome some of these limits on practical superdirectivity. We directly model a superdirective antenna in receive mode by calculating streamlines of Poynting vector field near the receiving antennas. Superdirectivity is achieved by expanding the shape of the effective area beyond the antenna physical aperture area. The degree of superdirectivity is parameterized by an effective area expansion distance. The theory predicts that superdirectivity is practical for electrically small and middle size antennas and electrically large antennas with a large aspect ratio. With this motivation, a 1.5 λ × 2 λ superdirective horn antenna with resonant screen structure in front of the antenna aperture is designed and fabricated.

410b2ce3-d1f7-40a6-b7d5-c3c2bb0377f6,Using instagram to increase student engagement with design history,2018,"In today’s rapidly evolving design disciplines, design history students should demonstrate an understanding of the social and cultural impact of design of both historical and contemporary designers and their methods. To increase student engagement with design history and discourse, we prototyped a new format for our design history course in Brigham Young University’s Industrial Design department. Our goal was to enable students to process designs they encounter, both in person and social media, through a critical and cultural perspective, and then turn those lenses towards their own design work with greater social and cultural awareness. To do this, we utilized Instagram as the primary platform (@byudesignhistory) for course discussion and altered the way we framed student assignments. This new curriculum was prototyped in the spring of 2018. Outcomes were measured by monitoring student engagement, responses, and comprehension scores on verbal and written assignments and examinations. Students also responded to a series of reviews to gather their perspectives on the class. Results indicate an increase in their understanding of the cultural position design holds in a way that was absent in student results from the previous course structure. If our course interventions are effective, students should move from concrete to abstract knowledge as well as from lower order to higher order thinking skills. Students will thus be better prepared to assess, understand and discuss both current and historical design cultures and trends while influencing their own design work through an informed perspective. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

9b807427-3492-4303-bfcc-6b1fadf997f6,Increasing the educational impact following a field study programme,2018,"Design students return from field trips abroad brimming with new ideas and a greater understanding of their chosen discipline. However, if their observations and knowledge are not soon applied, the students hold only fond memories of a fun trip abroad. We believe that student’s retention and application of concepts will increase if educators give students greater autonomy on the trip and also expect and enable opportunities to apply their accrued knowledge on their own projects upon returning home. Nine third and fourth-year industrial design students Brigham Young University participated in a weeklong field study abroad to Dutch Design Week (DDW) in Eindhoven, Netherlands. A week after the completion of the study abroad the students filled out a survey about their motivations, feelings, criticisms, and aspects of the trip that influenced them as designers. Three and a half months later the students took a second survey asking about how they have applied insights gained from participation in DDW to their current projects. The results from the both surveys suggest the impact of the field study trip decreased over time. The observations and more open-ended questions in the survey helped determine if and how the students applied their conceptual knowledge to their current projects as well as other outcomes of the trip. In addition, the paper suggests possible strategies and research opportunities for future field study experiences. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

3cf21165-16c0-4ae9-9133-acaf18995284,Information reduction and studio project frameworks,2018,"Studio projects increase from simple & straightforward to complex & indeterminate as undergraduate industrial design students’ progress through their educational experiences. As project complexity increases, students are faced with information overload and can struggle to move forward in a meaningful way. Complex Problem Solving studies and Cognitive Load Theory suggest information reduction as a way to grasp the critical aspects of a problem and move beyond the impasse inherent with too much information. Segmentation and chunking are common strategies for information reduction but the abstraction inherent in the chunking process provides better conceptual understanding. The simplified but meaningful results from the chunking process can then be leveraged to create a model or framework that helps students organise and clarify what they have observed as well as point to new opportunities for design activity. Despite the fear of oversimplification, significantly abstracted models have great “explanatory or predictive power” and can lead to rich results. Reviewing the concepts of complexity, cognitive load, and contrasting segmentation with data chunking, this paper will then highlight a portion of a student project where information reduction provided understanding beyond initial student impressions and encouraged them to move forward. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

As they increase in prevalence, how UAVs interact with each other and their environments will become increasingly important. The UAV air traffic control system will play an important role in keeping UAV-human interactions safe, effective, and efficient. The large number of automated agents, and the complex interactions between them, make this air traffic control system unusually complex. In this paper, the authors consider how the vertical distribution of UAVs affects an air traffic control system’s safety and efficiency. Several possible frameworks are examined, including a free-flight system in which UAVs are allowed to distribute themselves within the entire airspace; a stratified system where different layers are used for travel in different directions, and a compromise system where layers are specified, but vertical course deviation for conflict avoidance is permitted. Investigations are made into how prioritizing some UAVs over others in a hierarchy (for instance, giving emergency services UAVs a separate layer, independent of recreational or commercial users) could affect this system. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, its horizontal curve data were highly segmented and not ready for crash prediction model development for curve segments. In 2014, an algorithm named the horizontal alignment finder (HAF) algorithm was developed to identify horizontal curves on rural two-lane two-way highways. Its accuracy was about 85 percent with 2012 data. The HAF was recently recalibrated for all other types of UDOT's highways and found to be applicable to them without any modifications in its main algorithm. During the calibration, six types of errors were identified. Four of the six errors were fixed and the HAF was calibrated with new 2015 LiDAR data.

With the development of reliable welding tools and precise control systems, FSW of steels has reached a new level of technical maturity. High-quality, long welds can be produced in many engineering steels. Compared to traditional fusion welding, FSW exhibits unique advantages producing joints with better properties. As a result of active control of the welding temperature and/or cooling rate, FSW has the capability of fabricating steel joints with excellent toughness and strength. For example, unfavorable phase transformations that usually occur during traditional welding can be avoided and favorable phase fractions in advanced steels can be maintained in the weld zone thus avoiding the typical property degradations associated with fusion welding. If phase transformations do occur during FSW of thick steels, optimization of microstructure and properties can be attained by controlling the heat input and post-weld cooling rate. © 2017",10.1016/j.jmst.2017.10.024

Healing feasibility was demonstrated by processing a tapered crack using a PCBN/W-Re tool with a 25 mm diameter shoulder and a pin length of 6.4 mm. The experiment showed that it was possible to heal a crack that begins narrow and then progressively grows up to a width of 2 mm. Bead on plate experiments were used to find the best parameters for creating a consolidated stir zone with the least amount of hardness difference compared to the base metal. Grain refinement in some specimens resulted in much higher stir zone hardness, compared to base metal. A plot of grain size versus microhardness showed a very strong inverse correlation between grain size and hardness, as expected from the Hall-Petch relationship. Corrosion testing was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of FSP on potential sensitization of the stir zone. After 1000 h of intermittent immersion in 3.5% saline solution at room temperature it was found that no corrosion products formed on the base material controls or on any of the friction stir processed specimens. © 2017",10.1016/j.jmst.2017.10.023

We show simple examples that work over erasure channels to achieve a security constraint, and then consider approaches to more practical coding constructions for Gaussian channels that satisfies both reliability and security constraints on the network. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.",

Short term sensor installation could be greatly improved if individual sensors did not have to be connected to a distant power source. This paper proposes that small aerodynamic vibration energy harvesting devices could provide power directly to sensors and simplify installation. To investigate feasibility, the simplest known energy harvester configuration is chosen. A mathematical model to represent the device is then developed. A test scenario using the aerodynamic vibrations present on the F-15B aircraft is then incorporated into the model. The test results are analyzed to determine if the energy harvesting device can produce sufficient energy to justify further analysis. Finally, potential design improvements are discussed. © held by the author; distribution rights International Foundation for Telemetering.",

The results obtained from this analysis are compared to results from a finite-element analysis and experimental data. After verifying these models, the advantages and disadvantages of each stiffener type are considered. This comparison will facilitate stiffener selection for future engineering applications.

As techniques for thick, rigid origami-based engineering design are being developed, origami is becoming increasingly more attractive as inspiration for complex systems. This paper proposes a process for designing origami-based conceal-and-reveal systems, which can be generalized to design other thick, rigid origami-based systems. The process is demonstrated through the development of three conceal-and-reveal systems that present a luxury product to the consumer. The three designs also confirm that multiple origami crease patterns represent viable approaches to achieving conceal-and-reveal motion. Copyright © 2018 ASME",10.1115/DETC2018-85224

Though many techniques have been developed to accommodate thickness in origami, creating 3D models of such thick-origami mechanisms is complex. The time and knowledge required to manually model an origami mechanism can impede the exploration of the design space and creation of robust designs. This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern. Models resulting from the program for several crease patterns are demonstrated with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the system. With further development of the data structures and program, this framework has the potential to help mitigate some of the barriers to more widespread use of origami-based design.

The gap between academic research and the industry adoption of these theories and methodologies can have real consequences. This paper explores current practices in industry that design engineers use to consider the social impact of products during the customer use stage. 30 people from nineteen different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a product’s social impact. Although social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common evaluative processes discussed in the literature, not a single company interviewed used either of these processes despite affirming that they do consider social impact in product design.

This paper compares over-design to redesign as approaches to address the emergence of future requirements. Net present value (NPV) analyses of several real world applications are examined from the perspective of manufacturers and customers. This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher net present value than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low.

CVI results from incompetent venous valves. The purpose of venous valves is to prevent retrograde blood flow to the lower limbs. Valve failure can lead to edema, pain, and ulcers. One solution that has great potential is to create an implantable venous valve that could restore function of the venous system. No prosthetic venous valves are clinically used currently because of problems with biocompatiblility and thrombogenicity caused by high shear rates. This paper presents a prosthetic venous valve that could overcome these difficulties by using carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). This material has been proven to be thrombo-resistant, biocompatible due to its non-reactive properties, and durable. The valve was designed to be initially open and to close with physiological pressures. Finite element modeling showed that, with a hydrostatic pressure of 20 mmHg (the minimum hydrostatic pressure in the common femoral vein), it fully closed with a maximum stress of 117 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of CI-CNTs. A computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated the valve would cause a maximum shear rate of 225.1 s− 1, which is less than the maximum shear rate in the body. Hence, this valve would be less likely than previous prosthetic valves to develop blood clots. Currently, this is the lowest shear rate reported for a prosthetic venous valve. These results demonstrate that a CI-CNT prosthetic venous valve has the potential to be an effective treatment for CVI. Copyright © 2018 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2018-86164

The resulting images rely on visual persistence as laser light scatters from the particle, which is rapidly swept through the 3-D pattern. Control can be maintained while moving the particle with air speeds up to 2 m/s. A desire to greatly increase the sweep speed motivates a re-examination of the fundamentals of photophoresis-based laser-particle traps. Most explanations offered are qualitative, with differing opinions as to whether, for example, asymmetric heating or asymmetric thermal accommodation is primarily at work. Which particles become trapped in the beam is typically based on self-selection, as a variety of particles with possible differing shapes and sizes are offered to the laser focus for capture. Characteristics that make some particles preferred over others are especially relevant. There is broad consensus that structure in the laser focus greatly aids in stable trapping. Nevertheless, it is still possible for even a relatively smooth TEM00 beam to capture and hold particles. Moreover, even in a structured focus (i.e. with aberrations and local intensity minima and maxima), questions remain as to exactly how a particle becomes stably trapped in certain beam locations. A zoomed-in look at trapped particles reveals oscillations or orbits with excursions over tens of microns and accelerations up to 10 gs.

Exploring intent-based replanning in multi-objective path planning,2018,"In goal-based tasks such as navigating a robot from location A to location B in a dynamic environment, human intent can mean to choose a specific trade-off between multiple competing objectives. For example, intent can mean to find a path that balances between ""Go quickly"" and ""Go stealthily"". Given human expectations about how a path balances such tradeoffs, the path should match the human's intent throughout the entire execution of the path even if the environment changes. If the path drifts from the human's intent because the environment changes, then a new robotic-path needs to be planned - referred to as path-replanning. We discuss here three system-initiated triggers (prompts) for path-replanning. The objective is to create an interactive replanning system that yields paths that consistently match human intent. The triggers are to replan (a) at regular time intervals, (b) when the current robotic path deviates from the user intent, and (c) when a better path can be obtained from a different homotopy class. Further, we consider one user-generated replanning trigger that allows the user to stop the robot anytime to put the robot onto a new route. These four trigger variants seek to answer two fundamental critical questions: When is a re-planned path acceptable to a human? and How should a planner involve a human in replanning? © 2018 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2304546

The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 1 m. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. In general, comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. The DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites. Liquefaction resistance from the DPT (30% probability) also correlated reasonably well with that from Becker penetration testing (BPT).

Detailed information about the magnitude of distortion and the shape of the distortion profile and how it changes through blade rows increases the understanding of flow physics and helps predict aerodynamic performance. Using full annulus URANS simulations, this paper analyzes what happens to distortion as it passes through the rotor and stator blade rows at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. With these descriptors, evidence of pressure-induced swirl is shown at the fan inlet. It is also shown that although there is very little distortion at the 10% span of the inlet, after passing through the rotor blade row the 10% span has the greatest amount of total pressure and total temperature distortion. This radial migration of distortion is attributed to the high hade angle of the hub. The total pressure and total temperature profiles have significant circumferential phase shifts after passing through the rotor and slight phase shifts after passing through the stator. In general, the calculated phase shifts are greatest at the 10% and 90% spans, the nearest locations to the hub and the tip clearance gap, respectively. Copyright © 2018 ASME.",10.1115/GT2018-77221

As with CST, Béziers and B-Splines provide direct control over aerodynamically meaningful features such as nose radius and boat-tail angle, but also provide more a intuitive parametrization of the rest of the airfoil surface. We show the efficacy of B-Spline-based parametrizations for approximating airfoil coordinates and for clean-sheet airfoil design. Finally, we show that this parametrization is ideally suited for progressive design. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",10.2514/6.2018-3949
fffddb5d-3bbd-4442-97a6-0bfe09cbc50f,Analysis of distortion transfer and generation through a compressor using the harmonic balance approach,2018,"Inlet flow distortion significantly affects an engine’s overall performance. It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Harmonic Balance simulations are shown to have significantly lower computational costs than simulations with a conventional unsteady solver. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Mechanism geometry, materials, and manufacturing are proposed and the results analyzed and tested. A parametric finite element model of the CCAFP was created to analyze the force-deflection and strain-deflection relationships and the predicted behavior was verified by experiment. Analytic models of stress-limiting cam-surfaces suggest even larger motions may be possible when not limited by current practical constraints. The CCAFP is demonstrated and tested at multiple size scales and in multiple materials, ranging from 28.6 mm diameter 4130 steel (achieving 9 degrees of angular deflection) to 3 mm diameter NiTi (achieving an angular deflection of 85 degrees). The results are generalized to apply to a range of applications, and the CCAFP particularly shows promise for implementation in minimally invasive surgical instruments to decrease instrument size while maintaining instrument performance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.precisioneng.2017.11.001
6e87fa01-43fd-4384-90ca-b99ab22cbfe2,Strut-and-tie models for masonry walls with openings,2018,"There is a large collection of masonry models due to the highly complex and heterogeneous nature of masonry as a structural material. While the individual masonry components can be considered isotropic at the material level, masonry assemblages are anisotropic at the structural level. These properties of masonry make it difficult to develop models that accurately describe the material behavior for all analysis and design scenarios. One analysis tool that is efficient and reliable is the use of stress fields. Stress fields are based on the lower-bound theorem of the theory of plasticity. Stress fields have been combined with the truss analogy to produce what is known as the strut-and-tie modelling procedure. This article presents ongoing research that has the objective to develop strut-and-tie modelling procedures for masonry. The presented methodology uses the existing strut-and-tie guidelines for reinforced concrete as starting point and applies that methodology to the modelling of several masonry shear walls with openings. The shear strength predictions from the proposed strut-and-tie modelling methodology are shown to perform well compared to the experimental strengths. This is associated with the ability of the strut-and-tie modelling procedure to account for the geometric particularities of each wall. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",
7cd82579-2b5a-41a2-adb6-e601ba2fbf3f,Finite element model of dry-stack masonry shear walls,2018,"Dry-stack masonry systems are constructed without mortar between the blocks. This reduces the cost of specialty laborers and the variability in construction that exists from the application of mortar. Several dry-stack systems exist and can be subcategorized as interlocking systems or surface bonded systems. In interlocking systems, the blocks are connected by their geometry while in surface bonded systems the blocks are connected by a structural coating applied to the surface of the wall. This article describes a finite element model that can be used to predict the in-plane capacity and behavior of dry-stack masonry walls with a surface coating. Four walls were built and tested for their in-plane shear capacity. Two walls were unreinforced and ungrouted and two walls were reinforced and grouted at 1.22 m both vertically and horizontally. The results of these tests were used to validate the finite element model. The finite element model was developed using VecTor2. The numerical response is in good agreement to measured response. For the ungrouted unreinforced walls, the calculated maximum load was within 4% and 14% of the measured maximum loads. For the reinforced and grouted walls, the calculated maximum load was within 8% and 1% of the measured maximum loads. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",

Freshman students may have difficulties regulating their emotions when exposed to new or complex topics such as engineering design. Consequently, they may become frustrated or discouraged as the semester progresses that can lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. In contrast, novice students may experience feelings of hope and interest that may foster positive learning outcomes in engineering design. The authors explored freshmen engineering students’ (n = 58) levels of self-efficacy and topic emotions while participating on a freshmen-level engineering and graphics design course. Our findings suggests that while positive and negative topic emotions are inversely related, both seem to be associated with self-efficacy. Further, topic emotions appear to mediate self-efficacy as topic emotions such as curiosity, happiness, and interest were reported by engineering students during engineering design activities. Self-efficacy increased over the course of the semester for these freshman engineering design students. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.",

The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5"" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250°F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8""x8""x8""). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel. This study demonstrates the ability to consistently produce high quality fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar using an innovative, low cost, high production rate, three-dimensional braiding process. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

Engineering education has an interest in helping students learn how to best collaborate in these types of situations. Four years of multi-university, multi-disciplinary engineering capstone projects are investigated and related literature is thoroughly examined to demonstrate which collaboration tools, at different stages of the product development process, meet the needs of virtual team members for communication tasks. Student engineering design teams with team members located at various locations should, during the early, middle, and late stages of the product development process, emphasize the use of collaboration tools that will best meet the needs of each stage. In the early stages, teams should emphasize rich communication mediums, such as in-person kick-off meetings. In the middle stages, tools which allow team members to perform their individual work while staying in-sync with their remotely located teammates, such as web conferencing and shared data editing tools, become important. In the late stages, as the team shifts from digital work to physical work, tools such as texting and in-person meetings become more necessary. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",

Recent improvements in measuring suction provided the ability to make fast, accurate SWCCs in the lab but sample throughput drastically limits the number that can be produced. Collocating matric suction and water content sensors in situ would add many more SWCCs to the knowledge base. The objective of this study is to determine how well in situ generated SWCCs using a new, calibrated matric sensor compare to those created in the lab. Field and lab SWCCs compared quite well, but a few factors reduced their agreement. In coarser textured soils, living roots caused a divergence as the soil suction increased. Not surprisingly, intact core samples compared more favorably than disturbed. In finer textured soils, comparisons were favorable, but were also affected when laboratory samples were disturbed. Data suggest collocated in situ sensors could provide an important augmentation to laboratory data for developing a wide range of SWCCs. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

e32a82d7-7bd3-4427-b98b-52c7b95d0e7e,Lateral resistance of piles within corrugated metal sleeves,2018,"Pile foundations supporting bridge abutments are often driven inside corrugated metal pipe sleeves (CMS) which extend through the approach fill to reduce downdrag or for construction expediency. The annular space between the pile and the sleeve is typically filled with uncompacted pea gravel. Designers often assume that the lateral resistance of the pile within the sleeve will be minimal; however, no test results are available to confirm this assumption. To investigate the lateral resistance of piles driven within CMS, a full-scale lateral load test was performed. The test pile configuration included a 32.4 cm (12.75 in.) pipe pile within a 60 cm (24 in.) CMS with uncompacted pea gravel filling the annular space. Results indicate that after small pile displacements, the lateral pile resistance was similar to that provided by an individual pipe pile and was even greater at larger displacements. As the pile displaced laterally, the gravel within the annular space became engaged and displaced the CMS into the compacted fill. Back-analyses indicate that the ultimate lateral pile resistance for this case can be approximated by treating the pipe-gravel-CMS as a composite pile having an EI equal to the pipe pile but with a diameter equal to the CMS. © ASCE.",10.1061/9780784481578.026

An increase of side and toe resistances, significant ground and driven piles and drilled shafts top settlements were observed following blasting. This increase and settlements were attributed to the increase of effective stress as the excess porewater pressure dissipated. The liquefaction-induced dragloads that developed, at the neutral plane ranged from 200 to 650 kN. The load and settlement distribution curves for each installed foundation during the application of load to the top of each foundation and after blasting are also discussed.

Important state infrastructure was seriously affected, including one of the major seaports in the country, the Port of Manta, located in the city that bears its name. This paper focuses on the geotechnical exploration, site characterization, and analyses performed for the marginal wharf's embankment of the port, where clear evidence of liquefaction was observed. Laboratory results showed that the embankment was composed of gravelly sand and sandy gravels, which limited the applicability of common exploration techniques, such as SPT and CPTu tests. Subsequently, liquefaction triggering evaluations were performed based on Vs and the Chinese dynamic penetration test (DPT), which can account for the large gravel content in the soils. The results of this evaluation are presented and compared with field observations showing that these methods correctly identified the potential for liquefaction in the embankment. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481455.027

The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 100 cm. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. Comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. In general, the DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites.

However, such methods are difficult to implement on routine projects without the use of specialized software because the many iterative probabilistic calculations required. Prior research has introduced a simplified approach of using performance-based reference parameter maps in conjunction with correction equations that account for site-specific geotechnical and topographical conditions. This paper addresses the development of such performance-based reference parameter maps for the calculation of post-liquefaction volumetric strains and settlements in the free field. A study is performed and presented to assess the optimized grid spacing for a performance-based volumetric strain analysis and development of a strain performance-based reference parameter map. Recommended grid spacing values as correlated to USGS seismic hazard maps for PGA are provided to produce a maximum of 0.15% strain error in interpolating the reference strain for the simplified performance-based analysis approach. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481455.041

If different turbine hub heights and rotor diameters are included in the same wind farm, the wake interference in the farm will be reduced, resulting in a lower cost of energy (COE) than a farm with identical turbines. In this paper, we present a method to model wind farm COE in farms with hub heights and rotor diameters that vary across the wind farm. We also demonstrate how to optimize these wind farms to minimize COE. The results show that COE can be greatly reduced in wind farms with non-homogeneous turbines, especially when the turbines are spaced close together. For a unidirectional wind rose, including different turbine design in the wind farm has a similar decrease in COE to spreading the wind turbines farther apart. When the rotor diameter and hub height of the wind turbines in a farm are optimized uniformly, a COE decrease of 4% to 13% (depending on the grid spacing and wind shear exponent) is achieved compared to the baseline. When the rotor diameter and turbine heights are optimized non-uniformly, with two different diameters and heights throughout the farm, there is a COE decrease of 22% to 41% compared to the baseline. For a more spread wind rose with a dominant probability from the west, there is a COE decrease between 3% and 10% for uniformly optimized rotor diameter and height compared to the baseline. With two optimized rotor diameters and heights through the farm, a COE decrease of 3% to 19% is achieved. For a similar wind rose shifted such that the dominant wind direction is from the northwest, a COE decrease between 3% and 10% results from uniformly optimized wind turbines compared to the baseline. A COE decrease of 3% to 17% compared to the baseline occurs with two different turbines are optimized throughout the wind farm. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

37f70a50-3321-49d2-b399-8803cf2dda6c,Simplified modeling for soot formation from solid fuels,2018,"Modeling soot formed from solid complex fuels such as coal or biomass is difficult and rare in the combustion community. Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been developed. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second assumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems. © 2018 Western States Section/Combustion Institute. All rights reserved.",

Six engine power conditions ranging from 25% to 150% engine thrust request were measured using a 71-microphone linear ground array located approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer. Mixing noise trends with engine power for the round-nozzle F-35B are similar to those of a nominally rectangular-nozzle high-performance jet aircraft [Harker et al, AIAA, 2016]. Cross-correlation and coherence measures are used to corroborate and confirm identifications of fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise contributions from a concurrent study of the F-35B dataset [Neilsen et al., AIAA, 2018]. The relationships observed between multiple spatiospectral lobes seen in the maximum radiation regions of prior and concurrent high-performance aircraft noise studies [Leete et al., AIAA, 2018] are confirmed and expanded upon. Correlograms help identify how the multiple spatiospectral lobes have different apparent phase speeds across the array, corresponding to different directionality, some components of which also change with engine power. Increased overlap of lobes with increased engine power appears to drive global decreases in field coherence. Finally, the structure of the spatiospectral lobes appears to be more visible in nondimensionalized coherence length than in the spectrum itself. Broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) is found in the upstream direction at engine powers of 75% engine thrust request and above. Coherence is also used to separate BBSAN from jet mixing noise because the BBSAN is coherent within the relevant frequency range while adjacent fine-scale mixing noise is not. However, correlation and coherence analyses show that the upstream BBSAN signature is related to sound received in the peak radiation region dominated by the spatiospectral lobes. Possible links between the shock-associated noise and the spatiospectral lobes are discussed. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

0e658171-1e73-468a-80d2-cb5b436f6d25,Dependence of high-performance military aircraft noise on frequency and engine power,2018,"To further understand the unique characteristics of military aircraft noise, the sound field in the vicinity of a tied-down F-35B was measured for various engine powers, from 25% to 150% Engine Thrust Request (ETR). Synchronous measurements along a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer were used to image the entire field through multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography (M-SONAH). The field in the direction of maximum radiation consists of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain, which are manifest as multiple local maxima in space for a fixed frequency or multiple peaks in the spectra at a fixed location. Multiple lobes are observed at non-afterburning and afterburning engine conditions. As frequency increases for a given engine power, lobes appear towards the sideline and shift aft until they disappear beyond the measurement aperture and new lobe(s) take their place. As engine power is increased at a fixed frequency, the forwardmost lobe increases in its relative contribution to the field, which is a major contributing factor to the forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Field reconstructions and data in the forward direction outside of the region of maximum radiation show the presence of broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) for 75% ETR and above. Reconstructions along the nozzle lipline of the jet indicate the BBSAN originates from approximately the same region as the sources for the main radiation direction. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

c821ce15-04f8-4513-9751-282c76fb4311,Inclusion of broadband shock-associated noise in spectral decomposition of noise from highperformance military aircraft,2018,"Attempts to reduce the noise from high-performance military aircraft requires an understanding of the different jet noise generation mechanisms. The primary noise sources originate from interactions between turbulent mixing noise associated with large and finescale turbulent structures and the ambient air. A nonideally expanded jet also contains broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way decomposition of the spectral density measured near a tied-down F-35B quantifies the contribution from each type of noise. The decomposition is performed on noise from a ground-based, linear array of microphones, approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer, which spanned an angular aperture of 35° to 152° (relative to engine inlet). This large spatial aperture allows for a detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral decompositions match the measured spectral levels with three main exceptions: 1) the F-35B noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The main peak of the F-35B broadband shock-associated noise, evident from 35°-70°, has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. The F-35B broadband shockassociated noise peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale BBSAN and those recently reported for the F/A-18E [Tam et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 422, 2018, pp. 92-111].

06886807-084f-4151-b28e-e95d1f9ac7b7,Comparison of noise from high-performance military aircraft for ground run-up and flyover operations,2018,"While the majority of jet noise analysis takes place with a static jet or aircraft, airbase and community military jet noise exposure happens for the most part when the aircraft is in flight. Comparisons between flyover and ground run-up measurements for high-performance military aircraft have not been previously published. This paper presents comparisons between static ground run-up and flyover measurements for the F-35 operating at 150% Engine Thrust Request. The overall sound pressure levels and spectra are shown for the two scenarios, as well as indicators of nonlinear propagation and shock content, specifically the derivative skewness and average steepening factor. The overall sound pressure level is reduced in the peak radiation direction aft of the aircraft but increased in the forward direction. The peak frequency of the noise is relatively unaffected by flight effects, though the amplitude of each frequency may vary. The increase in level in the forward direction results in shock formation that is absent during ground run-up measurements. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

NASA’s X-57 Maxwell X-plane is a demonstrator for this technology, and it features a row of high-lift propellers distributed along the leading edge of its wing to enable better aerodynamic efficiency at cruise and improved ride quality in addition to less noise and emissions. This study applies adjointbased multidisciplinary design optimization to this highly coupled design problem. The propulsion, aerodynamics, and structures are modeled using blade element momentum theory, the vortex lattice method, and finite element analysis, respectively, and the full mission profile is discretized and analyzed. The design variables in the optimization problem include the altitude profile, the velocity profile, battery weight, propeller diameter, blade profile parameters, wing thickness distribution, and angle of attack. Optimizations take on the order of 10 hours, and a 12% increase in range is observed. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.",10.2514/6.2018-1384
528474e4-e89f-408f-a45f-bbddf0c7b56d,New flow assurance system with high speed subsea fiber optic monitoring of pressure and temperature,2018,"Subsea production control systems are instrumented to constantly monitor flowline pressure and temperature at key locations to prevent plugging and introduce mitigating control strategies. New fiber optic sensors with ruggedized construction and non-electrical components are subjected to accelerated aging tests and deployed in several installations with long service life. An overview of current progress with fiber optic technology is provided for fatigue monitoring, temperature, pressure, and strain sensing. Recent developments include improved service life, novel bonding methods, pipeline sensor station improvements, sensor calibration, and long-term fatigue analysis. The latest advancements are validated on multiple installations on a subsea tieback in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf of Mexico at 6, 500 ft depth. A prior third-party sensor design experienced multiple non-recoverable sensor failures. A new sensor station design is employed on two Flowline Terminations to monitor pressure and temperature at a rate of 100 Hz. Subsea tiebacks are susceptible to flow assurance issues caused by plugging events such as hydrate formation. The system was originally designed to track pig location but transitioned to pressure and temperature sensing. An issue with the transition was the lack of calibration relating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain levels to the actual process conditions. A novel method is presented for in situ adjustment of the sensor array calibration. During the calibration procedure, the sensors produced unanticipated results during pipeline flow shut-in and later startup operations. The sensors helped uncover a configuration of the flowline and sensor locations that is valuable for detecting hydrate forming conditions at a key junction location. The sensors are located before and after the junction of two flowlines in the mixing zone of the pipeline streams. The novel contributions of this study are the high speed data collection, in situ fiber optic calibration, review of advancements in fiber optic sensing technology, and a field case study with multiple sensing arrays. The developments are part of the Clear Gulf study, a collaboration between the offshore energy industry and NASA that was formed in 2010. The objective of the Clear Gulf study is to employ space technology and testing facilities for use in the upstream industry to advance subsea sensor technology. The highly sensitive monitoring systems developed as part of this study are used to give early warnings for flow assurance issues, structural failures, or catastrophic events.

In crowd- funding, an entrepreneur often has to decide how to disclose the campaign status in order to collect as many contributions as poss ible. Such decisions are difficult to make primarily due to incomp lete information. We propose information design as a tool to help the entrepreneur to improve revenue by influencing backers' bel iefs. We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. Our results demons trate that the immediate-disclosure policy is not optimal when backers follow thresholding policies despite its ease of implementat ion. With appropriate heuristics, an entrepreneur can benefit from dynamic information disclosure. Our work sheds light on inform ation design in a dynamic setting where agents make decisions using thresholding policies. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.",

Field investigations showed that it occurs in diverse geographic locations around the U.S. and is a source of continued maintenance concern for railroads. Water appeared to be a significant factor involved in concrete bottom tie abrasion. Ballast fouling, center-binding cracking, rail surface profile variations, and large track movement during loading was seen in locations with concrete bottom tie abrasion. Bumps or track stiffness changes were often found at locations of abrasion damage. Specifically, some locations with known stiff track conditions exhibited significant abrasion damage.

This paper introduces the results obtained from a research project on blast induced liquefaction, performed at a trial site located in Mirabello (near Ferrara, Italy), a little village strongly affected by liquefaction during the 2012 Emilia-Romagna earthquake. The liquefiable soils in this area contained significantly more fines than in previous blast tests. In particular, the objectives of the experiment were: (i) to evaluate liquefaction induced settlement of Apennine silts and sands, and Po River sands; (ii) to determine downdrag forces on pile foundations; (iii) to measure change in shear wave velocity/shear modulus with excess pore pressure; and (iv) to measure change in soil properties with time after liquefaction.

A geotechnical exploration, including boreholes, CPT soundings, and surface-based geophysical techniques, was performed to characterize the materials forming the wharf. The data and field observations are then analyzed and used to develop a geotechnical model of two cross-sections modeled in Plaxis2D, to conclude which is the most likely failure mechanism under a dynamic analysis. The results are compared against the deformations measured in a number cross sections of the wharf, suggesting that the failure can be explained by a combined effect of the dynamic increase in lateral earth pressures and the base rotation of the confining walls due to the lack of proper compaction of the rockfill prism below the confining walls. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481455.055

Tension is a viable means of stiffening a flat antenna aperture especially when stowed volume is paramount. Three folding patterns are introduced and the design guidelines are developed. Deployment kinematics follow the simplicity of a single degree of freedom mechanism for two of the three patterns. The panels are rigid, and articulations occur along the prescribed lines. These deployment architectures are compatible with storable tubular extendible member booms, articulated trusses, or continuous longeron coilable trusses, all commonly used to deploy spacecraft structures. High areal packaging densities were demonstrated: 1.0 m2/L for a diamond pattern with a high deployed aspect ratio and 0.5 m2/L for spiral and serpentine patterns compatible with high and low deployed aspect ratios. A double-layer material hinge method is also presented and used to enable the structures to fold, deploy, and be tensioned to a planar state. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

However, for novice engineering students, conceptualizing engineering design activities is not an easy task. To do so, they must overcome cognitive blocks to facilitate unique and adequate engineering design solutions. This effect may be compounded when engineering design projects centered around service learning are introduced. The intent of this study was to explore if and what types of conceptual blocks may be present among novice engineering students when design heuristic cues are provided in the classroom. Findings suggest that using classroom interventions around design heuristic, students had a difficult time ""shaking off"" their conceptual blocks to the design solution. Primarily, communicative and perceptual blocks were found to predominate among novice engineering student groups. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.",

In this study we further expand the welding parameters to be of magnitudes higher than those previously reported to lower the cost and enable high volume joint production. Sound butt-joints were produced with aluminum alloy 6111-T4 blanks with welding speeds up to 6000, mm/min. Tensile tests of the joint pieces show >97% joint efficiency in terms of ultimate tensile strength. The T4 natural aging and grain refinement is found to contribute to the superior joint properties. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis is used to qualitatively study the local shear texture inside the nugget zones of the welds. The shear texture result is a good indicator of the material flow directions in the nugget zones. The flow directions behind the rotation tool are found to be flattened towards the top surface of the workpiece when the welding speed is increased, suggesting intense material mixing and transportation along the longitudinal welding direction (WD). © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2018.",10.1007/978-3-319-72484-3_27

In this study, we present a microstructural analysis of friction stir welded AA7075-T6 blanks with high welding speeds up to 3 M/min. Textures, microstructures, mechanical properties, and weld quality are analyzed using TEM, EBSD, metallographic imaging, and Vickers hardness. The higher welding speed results in narrower, stronger heat-affected zones (HAZs) and also higher hardness in the nugget zones. The material flow direction in the nugget zone is found to be leaning towards the welding direction as the welding speed increases.

According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzle–plate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzle–plate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzle–plate distances.

845c579f-0133-4a34-a9f1-99e831aae591,A graph-theoretic understanding of network-wide implications of local cyber protections for mission assurance,2018,"Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2305957

However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: Image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: First, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible. © 2018 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2311281

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement, lime and sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. Two specimen heights, 50 and 140 mm, with diameter of 45 mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, respectively were used. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behavior: the larger the confinement, the more the non-linear behavior. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson's ratio and the tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. A numerical model was developed that accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear elastic phased analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson's ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson's ratio was approximated using the model proposed by Ottosen. The numerical model presented satisfactory results, even close to the failure, when cracking is significant. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",

It was developed to establish suitable teaching practice to educate students on efficient design methods in a distributed product realisation projects in conjunction with an industrial partner. Students work in international teams formed from multiple partner universities. Communication is primarily through video-conferencing and other synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to perform design tasks including the vision, conceptual design, detail design and prototyping. Students ultimately meet during the final workshop at the end of the course to assemble and test prototypes and to disseminate their work to the company and wider public. The CODEVE methodology was tested in the Erasmus+ funded project called Networked Activities for Realisation of Innovative Products (NARIP) from 2015-2107. It has been implemented in academic institution in Europe. This paper discusses applicability of this methodology in the project which connects universities and industry across the Atlantic. Three universities are participating this year: Brigham Young University from Utah, USA with Industrial Design students, University of Technology and Economics of Budapest in Hungary with product design students and City, University of London from the UK with mechanical, aeronautical and electrical engineering students. The industrial partner is Black Diamond, a global company based in Utah, USA, while the manufacturing of prototypes and final workshop are hosted at City, University of London.

(Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea FiberOptic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms. The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes. This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage.

Their thermal property information is limited, lacking experimental data on key properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat, and CTE of the component fiber. This paper presents, for the first time, the thermal property data on kenaf fiber reinforced composites, and an approach to obtain the composite thermal properties based on constituent properties. Individual, plant-based fibers were measured independently and were then used to inform successful predictions of the effective thermal conductivity of the fiber reinforced composites. A unit cell model has been developed to predict the thermal properties of a planar, randomly oriented kenaf fiber-reinforced composite (near 22% volume fraction loading), which includes the effect of void content on the predicted thermal conductivity. A lower-level model is also developed for individual fiber thermal properties based on its constituents (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). To validate this multi-level model, experimental measurements of the thermal diffusivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and specific heat for the composite, the matrix, and the fibers were performed in the range from 30 °C to 160 °C, based on TMA, DSC, LFA, and transient electro-thermal (TET) techniques. Model results compare favorably with the experimental data, and are consistent with FEM modelling results based on fiber properties and fiber constituent materials (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). This approach provides the basis for understanding component contribution to the fiber properties, as well as a technique to obtain fiber composite thermal property based on component properties. The composite thermal property data also fills an information gap and can be directly used in component design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.09.095
a29afab4-c827-489a-bf16-d2f2e4e5539b,Improving full-scale models of new carbon capture technologies with uncertainty quantification,2018,"Carbon capture technologies for combustion power plants aim to remove CO2 from flue gas. One such technology is the novel CO2-Binding Organic Liquid (CO2BOL) process developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The process utilizes their anhydrous CO2BOL solvent in place of amine mixtures to reduce the energy penalty. A full-scale model of this system based on NETL's Case 10 power plant is projected to produce 7-16% more net electric power over a traditional MEA system for the same plant. These full-scale model predictions are promising, however full-scale simulations are difficult to validate using only bench-scale data. There are errors in both the measurements and models that need to be considered in addition to uncertainties introduced by up-scaling. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a statistical framework used to better understand these uncertainties as well as data gaps in models. By constraining models to data, distributions of model parameters are estimated and then propagated through the model to obtain distributions of key outputs such as carbon capture percent, energy penalty, stripper temperature, etc. The results from this UQ analysis aid the design of experiments (DoE) which identifies data gaps to fill to improve model accuracy. Using UQ and DoE effectively can reduce the development time of new carbon capture by years and save time and money on the path to a pilot, and ultimately full-scale, plant.

24cd3243-e57b-4ecf-9fc9-cf740590831b,Ground-based sense-and-avoid system for small unmanned aircraft,2018,"In this Paper, we present a complete, proof-of-concept sense-and-avoid solution for small unmanned aircraft systems, including a small low-cost ground-based radar system, multitarget tracking and estimation, collision detection, and an avoidance planner. We describe the development of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that provides a three-dimensional surveillance volume. The radar measurements are processed using the recursive random sample consensus algorithm, producing tracks for the intruders and the ownship. We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm.

While the term is applied to various types of infrastructure, the real application of sustainability practices needs to be applied to underground water infrastructure. In order to determine the best sustainable outcomes a common standard of weighing alternatives and making decisions should be followed. The International Standards Organization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental organization which facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations. The ISO has standards which can benefit sustainable infrastructure decision making specifically in 3 main areas: life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, and asset management.

Economic and Environmental Sustainability: Assessing the Global Warming Potential (GMP) of Your Underground Infrastructure,2018,"As municipalities across the United States and Canada focus on delivering the essentials of clean water, efficient wastewater treatment, and judicious control of storm water, government officials, engineers, and the companies that install, operate, and maintain piping infrastructure need to understand that a life cycle systems approach. Sustainability concerns apply to many critical resources such as water. On a per capita basis, the U.S. leads the world in water usage, with a substantial portion of water consumed/leaked by infrastructure systems. Because of water availability, competing water demands, and changing hydrologic conditions, the U.S. Department of Interior predicts that multiple water conflicts will occur in the western U.S. by 2025. In addition, decades of excessive demands on ecological systems have reduced their capacities to absorb and process emissions and wastes. Sustainable water infrastructure is vital to providing the American public with clean and safe water and helping to ensure the environmental, economic, and social health of the nation's communities. The increasing interest in sustainability has led to the development of sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessments (LCA) analyzing the embodied energy and environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool used to identify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity over the entire lifespan of the product. LCA studies also quantify and interpret the environmental flows to and from the environment (including emissions to air, water, and land, as well as the consumption of energy and other material resources) over the entire life cycle of a product (or process or service). By including the impacts throughout the product life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product and an accurate picture of the true environmental tradeoffs in product selection. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481660.020

Because of the lack of large scale tests, there is almost no guidance for engineers in assessing the lateral resistance of piles located close to these MSE walls. The objective of this study was to assess lateral pile resistance as a function of distance from the wall face and predict force induced in the reinforcements. Full-scale lateral load tests were conducted on 24 piles located at 2, 3, 4, and 5 pile diameters behind 4.6 and 6-m high MSE walls. P-multipliers were developed to account for the decrease in lateral soil resistance. Little reduction occurred for piles located more than about 4 pile diameters from the wall. Measured tensile forces in the MSE reinforcements increased as the load on the pile increased and decreased rapidly with transverse distance from the direction of loading. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict maximum tensile force induced in reinforcing elements by lateral loading. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).All Rights Reserved.",10.1061/9780784481608.009

However, many utilities have not historically tracked all of the elements of water main break data. One factor used to quantify the occurrences of failing underground pipe networks is water main break rates. Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in water delivery to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes. In April 2012, Utah State University published an initial comprehensive survey of water utilities. This was a survey of water main breaks and operating characteristics at utilities located in U.S. and Canada. Six years later in 2018, a new water main break study was released reviewing the national metric for citizens served per one mile of pipe, aggregate data on pipe material break rates, the analysis of age and corrosion in failure modes, and related observations on pressure, delivery volumes, effects of soil corrosivity, and trenchless technology practices. This paper reviews the newest water main break study metrics and findings and outlines various trends and projections of water main breaks in the U.S. and Canada which can be used to benchmark an organization's water main breaks and use this critical data in asset management plans. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481653.044

Inhaled corticosteroid is a popular medication for treating chronic respiratory diseases. Its side effects include decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. The aims of this study are to investigate the association of inhaled corticosteroids and fracture and to design a clinical support system for fracture prediction. The data of patients aged 20 years and older, who had visited healthcare centers and been prescribed with inhaled corticosteroids within 2002-2010, were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After excluding patients diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fractures before using inhaled corticosteroid, a total of 11645 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy were included for this study. Among them, 1134 (9.7%) were diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fracture. The statistical results showed that demographic information, chronic respiratory diseases and comorbidities, and corticosteroid-related variables (cumulative dose, mean exposed daily dose, follow-up duration, and exposed duration) were significantly different between fracture and nonfracture patients. The clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were designed with integrated genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) by training and validating the models with balanced training sets obtained by random and cluster-based undersampling methods and testing with the imbalanced NHIRD dataset. Two different objective functions were adopted for obtaining optimal models with best predictive performance. The predictive performance of the CDSSs exhibits a sensitivity of 69.84-77.00% and an AUC of 0.7495-0.7590. It was concluded that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may induce osteoporosis and exhibit higher incidence of hip or vertebrate fractures. The accumulated dose of ICS and OCS therapies should be continuously monitored, especially for patients with older age and women after menopause, to prevent from exceeding the maximum dosage. © 2018 Yung-Fu Chen et al.",10.1155/2018/9621640
50556c90-2aa1-4e84-9f77-4f14baf07200,Water main criticality scoring and GIS centric risk mitigation: Applying GIS spatial analysis tools and apps for greater insight for high risk underground infrastructure,2018,"With the pressure to provide excellent services under constrained budgets, utilities are adopting asset management as the synergistic framework combining strategic and financial planning, levels of service, and risk-based analysis to determine investments. GIS (geographic information system) helps to empower a utility with the tools to drive a robust and strategic, decision making process. When a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) has asset management functionality, the capabilities of service requests, inspections and work orders, capturing costs, and work history can be leveraged into asset condition and risk-based spatial analysis by determining what, when, why, and where the next round of investment should occur. A critical step in the process includes analyzing the data and location to potential take actions to reduce the risks. In alignment with ISO (International Standards Organization) 55000, risk is defined as the probability of failure (PoF) multiplied by the consequence of failure (CoF) which produces the business risk exposure (BRE). While calculating risk is important, the risk-based data can be used to build business cases and determine future projects. GIS can help users gain an understanding of what assets are high risk, where they are located and what factor can influence the risk. Risk-based analysis provides the reasoning for potential solutions and action. This paper defines and explores the use of GIS-centric analysis tools to enhance the asset management decision making process. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/9780784481653.014
d23aacf3-6525-43fd-ab28-8deda1729474,Alternative diffusion anisotropy measures for the investigation of white matter alterations in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,2018,"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is widely used to study the brain's white matter (WM) microstructure in a range of psychiatric and neurological diseases. As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

Hyperparameter optimization automates this process, but it can still take significant time. It has been found that hyperparameter optimization does not always result in induced models with significant improvement over default values, yet no systematic analysis of the role of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning has been conducted.

A dataset of still images and associated gravity vectors was collected and used to perform supervised learning. The network builds on a previously trained network and was trained to be able to approximate the attitude of the camera with an average error of about 8 degrees. Flight test video was recorded and processed with a relatively simple visual odometry method. The aircraft attitude is then estimated with the visual odometry as the state propagation and network providing the attitude measurement in an extended Kalman filter. Results show that the proposed method of having the neural network provide a gravity vector attitude measurement from the flight imagery reduces the standard deviation of the attitude error by approximately 12 times compared to a baseline approach. © 2017 IEEE.,10.1109/IROS.2017.8206443

These thermophysical properties are related to each other through temperature derivatives of thermodynamic relationships stemming from a temperature-dependent vapor-pressure correlation. The Riedel equation has been considered to be an excellent and simple choice among vapor-pressure correlating equations [ Velasco et al. J. Chem. Thermodyn. 2008, 40 (5), 789-797 ] but requires modification of the final coefficient to provide thermodynamic consistency with thermal data [ Hogge et al. Fluid Phase Equilib. 2016, 429, 149-165 ]. New predictive correlations with final coefficients in integer steps from 1 to 6 have been created for compounds with limited or no vapor-pressure data, based on the methodology used originally by Riedel [ Chem. Ing. Tech. 1954, 26 (2), 83-89 ]. Liquid heat capacity was predicted using these vapor-pressure correlations, and the best final coefficient values were chosen based on the ability to simultaneously represent vapor pressure and liquid heat capacity. This procedure improves the fit to liquid heat-capacity data by 5-10% (average absolute deviation), while maintaining the fit of vapor-pressure data similar to those of other prediction methods. Additionally, low-temperature vapor-pressure predictions were improved by relying on liquid heat-capacity data. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.iecr.7b03748

It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant biases on each sensor. © 2017 IEEE.,10.1109/IROS.2017.8206308

Design techniques for aperiodic arrays include thinning, numerical optimization, and other methods, but even with modern tools, designing electrically large aperiodic arrays remain computationally challenging. To reduce the complexity of the large aperiodic array design problem, we study the use of discrete rotated tiles with element positions and tile orientations optimized to minimize peak sidelobe level (PSLL). The directivity, frequency sensitivity of PSLL, and optimization complexity for uniform arrays, aperiodic arrays, and tiled arrays are compared. Based on many numerical examples, an approximate relationship between PSLL and array element number and density for aperiodic and tiled arrays is proposed as a convergence estimator for the design optimization process. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2017.2766679
8a669eef-f00b-4879-a134-bf5fe756c817,Nano-Composite Foam Sensor System in Football Helmets,2017,"American football has both the highest rate of concussion incidences as well as the highest number of concussions of all contact sports due to both the number of athletes and nature of the sport. Recent research has linked concussions with long term health complications such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and early onset Alzheimer’s. Understanding the mechanical characteristics of concussive impacts is critical to help protect athletes from these debilitating diseases and is now possible using helmet-based sensor systems. To date, real time on-field measurement of head impacts has been almost exclusively measured by devices that rely on accelerometers or gyroscopes attached to the player’s helmet, or embedded in a mouth guard. These systems monitor motion of the head or helmet, but do not directly measure impact energy. This paper evaluates the accuracy of a novel, multifunctional foam-based sensor that replaces a portion of the helmet foam to measure impact. All modified helmets were tested using a National Operating Committee Standards for Athletic Equipment-style drop tower with a total of 24 drop tests (4 locations with 6 impact energies). The impacts were evaluated using a headform, instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer, mounted to a Hybrid III neck assembly. The resultant accelerations were evaluated for both the peak acceleration and the severity indices. These data were then compared to the voltage response from multiple Nano Composite Foam sensors located throughout the helmet. The foam sensor system proved to be accurate in measuring both the HIC and Gadd severity index, as well as peak acceleration while also providing additional details that were previously difficult to obtain, such as impact energy. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.",10.1007/s10439-017-1910-9

Participants were 20 adults (ten males and ten females) with no history of speech, language, or hearing disorders. They produced six target utterances in the three speaking conditions. Movements of the following articulators were recorded with an electromagnetic articulograph: Mid tongue, front of tongue, jaw, lower lip, and upper lip. The kinematic metrics were averages derived from movement strokes defined by minima in the speed record of each articulator. These measures revealed a number of significant changes between the voiced and mouthed conditions, with relatively few differences between voiced and whispered speech. Significant increases in sentence duration, articulatory stroke count, and stroke duration as well as significant decreases in peak stroke speed, stroke distance, and hull areas were found in the mouthed condition. These findings suggest that both laryngeal activation and auditory feedback play an important role in the production of normally articulated vocal tract movements, and that the absence of these may account for the significant changes in articulation between the voiced and mouthed conditions. © 2014 IEEE.",10.1109/TASLP.2017.2738564

Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the relevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large data set in the first place. Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical ""building blocks"" that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be optimized for desirable behaviors. © 2017 The Author(s).",10.1038/s41524-017-0027-x

Link gain in hallways and connected laboratories looks similar at the two frequencies when the effect of lower effective receive antenna aperture with increasing frequency is removed. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation through a wall or around hallway corners exhibits approximately 5-20 dB (11 dB on average) greater loss beyond the 20 dB aperture loss at 24 GHz compared to that at 2.55 GHz. Fixed directional antennas increase path loss (PL) by an average of 13 dB when misaligned. Capacity for normalized signal-to-noise ratio is very similar in the two bands and is close to that for the optimal independent identically distributed case, indicating sufficient multipath for spatial multiplexing at 24 GHz. A ray-tracing study suggests that material loss must increase from 2.55 to 24 GHz to correctly predict the higher PL at 24 GHz in severely obstructed scenarios, indicating a need for future material characterization in high microwave bands. The results suggest that 24 GHz is a viable option to replace medium-range (10-30 m) NLOS wireless services currently operating at 2.4 GHz. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2017.2758390

Emphasis is placed on the largest water authority in the region of the earthquake, Kumamoto City, including damage metrics for various pipe materials and diameters. The greatest damage occurred at valves and other fundamental mechanisms of large diameter pipelines. Pipelines constructed of ERDIP and HDPE performed most favorably while steel and cast iron pipelines were shown to be the more vulnerable.

b2342b43-b67e-456e-b1a4-f5272d4d7f01,Plain-Style Preferences of US Professionals,2017,"Background: Although plain language is almost universally promoted by teachers of professional writing, editors, and communication professionals, some have argued that the effects of and preferences for plain style in written messages differ among groups of individuals. Research questions: 1. Do professionals prefer plain style? 2a. Do preferences differ for different categories of style? 2b. Do preferences differ for different groups of workers? Literature review: Style, the word- and sentence-level elements in a written text, is a critical element of plain language. There is evidence that plain style, however, affects readers differently based on their level of subject matter knowledge. Plain style is even criticized by a few. There is a long history of tensions surrounding linguistic prescriptivism, the notion that one manner of language use is superior to all others. Further, readers' preferences for writing style, plain or otherwise, may not be consistent across occupational positions, education levels, nationalities, personality types, or genders. Research methodology: We conducted a quantitative study of preferences for two major style categories (conciseness and word choice) using an online survey instrument. The student-recruiter technique provided us with usable responses from 614 working adults in the US. Using that data, we calculated proportions of respondents, with confidence intervals, who chose the plain-style options. We also used statistical tests to explore associations between preferences and respondent characteristics. Results and conclusions: Our findings support an overwhelming preference for plain style among US professionals who are native speakers of English. Reader preferences were stronger for elements associated with word choice than with conciseness. Those with lower education levels and blue-collar occupations had lower preferences for plain style. The study had two major limitations: 1. We investigated only two aspects of plain style rather than the full range of elements that make up plain language. 2. Our data-collection instrument presented readers with an artificial rather than an authentic reading experience. Future research may investigate the role of personality on stylistic preferences and the attributions readers make about writers based on their style. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TPC.2017.2759621

The acoustic radiation mode approach for computing sound power was developed in the early 1990s and has since been widely used. It has been shown to be a rather efficient approach for determining the radiated sound power. In previous research, radiation mode expressions have been developed for planar and spherical structures, as well as axisymmetric modes of internal and external radiation from cylinders. In this work, the radiation modes for external radiating cylinders which account for both axial and circumferential dependence are presented. The expressions are uniquely developed using cylindrical basis functions which are a more natural match to the geometry than past developments, which have been based on spherical harmonics. Higher order radiation modes than have been previously presented are shown. The “leapfrog effect”, whereby higher order modes leapfrog over lower modes in terms of their radiation efficiencies as the frequency goes above the cut-on frequency for those modes, is discussed in detail. The relationships between the mode efficiency and the coincidence effect associated with the cut-on frequencies of the vibration modes are described. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.jsv.2017.07.021

Losses for single antennas can be minimized using high conductivity materials. It is less well understood that loss for array antennas is also influenced by mutual coupling between array elements and the beamformer weights applied to the signal from each element. In this paper, we study the antenna loss and receiving efficiency for phased array antennas and focal plane phased array feeds. To better elucidate the physics of array antenna loss related to mutual coupling and beamformer weights, losses for a coupled array can be lumped into an array effective resistance similar to the loss resistance of an equivalent single antenna. Numerical results show that although the antenna loss for a single isolated array element is low, the array antenna loss can be significantly increased by mutual coupling, particularly for beams with a large scan angle. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2017.2748237
ba9b936e-4809-4b9c-b991-261dc1360991,Continuous permeability measurement during unidirectional vacuum infusion processing,2017,"Flow simulation for liquid composite molding is often performed to assist in process optimization and requires the permeability of the reinforcement to be characterized. For infusion under a flexible membrane, such as vacuum infusion, or for simulation of a part with non-uniform thickness, one must test the permeability at various levels of compaction. This process is time consuming and often relies on interpolation or extrapolation around a few experimental permeability measurements. To accelerate the process of permeability characterization, a small number of methodologies have been previously presented in the literature, in which the permeability may be tested at multiple fiber volume contents in a single test. Some of the methods even measure the permeability over a continuous range of thicknesses, thus requiring no later interpolation of permeability values. A novel method is presented here for the rapid measurement of permeability over a continuous range of fiber volume content, in a single unidirectional vacuum infusion flow experiment. The thickness gradient across the vacuum bag, as well as the fluid pressure at several locations in the mold were concurrently measured to calculate the fabric compressibility. An analytical flow model, which accounts for the compressibility, is then used by iterating the fitting constant in a permeability model until the predicted flow front progression matches empirical measurement. The method is demonstrated here for two reinforcement materials: (1) a fiberglass unbalanced weave and (2) a carbon biax non-crimped fabric. The standard deviation across the multiple experiments for each material and flow orientation ranged from 12.8% to 29.7%. Validation of these results was performed by comparing the resulting permeability with multiple non-continuous permeability measurement methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",10.1177/0731684417721660

Boundary element analysis is used to solve the fluid Stokes equation whereas the hydrodynamic membrane load is computed via isogeometric analysis under the assumption that the membrane is a hyper-elastic thin shell with negligible bending resistance. The smoothness of the T-spline basis functions accommodate large deformations of the capsule without the need for additional smoothing techniques, and can be used to accurately compute the membrane load. A balanced distribution of membrane elements can be constructed using an unstructured locally refined mesh. These properties are coupled with an adaptive temporal implicit integration scheme. Several benchmark examples are solved to illustrate the accuracy and potential of the method.

This paper addresses the collection of FBG reflection spectra from wavelength division multiplexed sensors at fast acquisition rates. The spectral and temporal resolution is first derived as a function of the tunable filter and measurement system properties. The method is applied to impact loading investigations of a stiffened composite skin panel. The reflected spectrum of each FBG in an array, embedded in the panel, is collected at 100 kHz during the impact events with a spectral resolution down to 40 pm. Visualization of the FBG responses to these impact events, including the presence of spectral distortion in some FBG spectra, is presented. Future analyses based on the full-spectral data sets can enable the assessment of the localized progression of internal damage in such structures. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/JSEN.2017.2750327
bc6f5362-0651-49db-b21a-f9741592b796,Layering Security at Global Control Points to Secure Unmodified Software,2017,"Developing secure software is inherently difficult, and is further hampered by a rush to market, the lack of cybersecurity-trained architects and developers, and the difficulty of identifying flaws and deploying mitigations. To address these problems, we advocate for an alternative paradigm-layering security onto applications from global control points, such as the browser, operating system, or network. This approach adds security to existing applications, relieving developers of this burden. The benefits of this paradigm are three-fold-(1) increased correctness in the implementation of security features, (2) coverage for all software, even non-maintained legacy software, and (3) more rapid and consistent deployment of threat mitigations and new security features. To demonstrate these benefits, we describe three concrete instantiations of this paradigm- MessageGuard, a system that layers end-to-end encryption in the browser; TrustBase, a system that layers authentication in the operating system; and software-defined perimeter, which layers access control at network middleboxes. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/SecDev.2017.20
bb599fd6-f406-4fa5-939a-99c1da41d59b,Polyethylene Glycol Based Changes to β-Sheet Protein Conformational and Proteolytic Stability Depend on Conjugation Strategy and Location,2017,"The development of chemical strategies for site-specific protein modification now enables researchers to attach polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a protein drug at one or more specific locations (i.e., protein PEGylation). However, aside from avoiding enzyme active sites or protein-binding interfaces, distinguishing the optimal PEGylation site from the available alternatives has conventionally been a matter of trial and error. As part of a continuing effort to develop guidelines for identifying optimal PEGylation sites within proteins, we show here that the impact of PEGylation at various sites within the β-sheet model protein WW depends strongly on the identity of the PEG-protein linker. The PEGylation of Gln or of azidohomoalanine has a similar impact on WW conformational stability as does Asn-PEGylation, whereas the PEGylation of propargyloxyphenylalanine is substantially stabilizing at locations where Asn-PEGylation was destabilizing. Importantly, we find that at least one of these three site-specific PEGylation strategies leads to substantial PEG-based stabilization at each of the positions investigated, highlighting the importance of considering conjugation strategy as an important variable in selecting optimal PEGylation sites. We further demonstrate that using a branched PEG oligomer intensifies the impact of PEGylation on WW conformational stability and also show that PEG-based increases to conformational stability are strongly associated with corresponding increases in proteolytic stability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00281

In this paper, a receding horizon control is utilized with information based reward measures to accomplish these two competing mission objectives. This approach for cooperatively searching and tracking has proven to be effective in past work. However, it is not generally scalable for large numbers of vehicles due to the computational expense required when generating joint path decisions. This paper proposes a method to dynamically group vehicles with neighbors that have intersecting decision spaces, thus reducing computational cost while still maintaining reasonable performance. Each vehicle also decides its ideal event horizon based upon inferred knowledge of the operational environment, further reducing cost. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062726

A network reconstruction algorithm was applied to Twitter data to determine causal relationships among topics discussed by popular Twitter users. Causal relationships in this context means that the topics tweeted by a single user influences the topics tweeted by another user, regardless of sentiment. A user that causally influences other users, without themselves being strongly influenced is identified as a trendsetter. This work seeks to identify potential trendsetters among popular Twitter users and demonstrating that causal influence does not always directly correlate with a user's popularity in terms of followers-demonstrating that popularity alone may not be sufficient for identifying trendsetters on Twitter. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062645

Current state of the art metal additive manufacturing methods such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) allow for intricate parts with high mechanical strength but at the cost of increased surface roughness on internal faces of waveguide structures. This paper investigates the contribution to loss of the increased surface roughness on a set of SLM WR42 waveguides printed with a standard ALSi10Mg aluminum powder, and compares their attenuation performance to purchased single-piece WR42 waveguides and to an industry-standard method for CNC machining waveguide multi-piece assemblies. Single-piece construction of RF parts produces lower attenuation than multi-piece assembly, and lower surface roughness directly leads to lower attenuation, as expected. SLM RF waveguides had better part consistency and comparable or better attenuation performance compared to CNC waveguides, showing that this manu-facturing method has reached the point where it can be used in RF waveguide assemblies. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/MWSYM.2017.8058605

5f86659e-2037-4aca-a7cb-9516005d756a,A comparison of model predictive control and PID temperature control in friction stir welding,2017,"Temperature control of friction stir welding (FSW) via model predictive control (MPC) is investigated in Al 7075-T7. Two MPC controllers are compared against two well-tuned PID controllers to obtain a direct comparison of MPC and current FSW controllers. One MPC controller uses a first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) model derived from a simplified conduction-advection view of the stir zone. The other MPC controller uses the Hybrid Heat Source model that describes heat conduction in the plate and tool. At quasi steady-state conditions, all four controllers can easily hold temperature within 2 °C of the setpoint in the absence of large disturbances. Once the weld is past the initial traverse, the FOPDT controller is superior to the Hybrid Heat Source controller with regards to modeled-disturbance rejection and setpoint changes. The FOPDT controller is competitive with well-tuned PID controllers in this region of the weld. During the initial traverse, the Hybrid Heat Source controller and PID controller with regulator gains were able to control temperature within 5 °C of the setpoint, compared to a typical deviation of 20–30 °C when uncontrolled. During this period, the FOPDT controller and PID controller with servo gains could not maintain satisfactory temperature control. MPC is demonstrated to be a viable control method for FSW. Temperature control before reaching steady state for both MPC and PID is shown to be feasible, but more difficult than for steady state. Recommendations are given for when each controller might be preferred in various circumstances, based upon the results shown herein. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.07.015

This literature review builds on four previously conducted literature reviews in similar domains. Out of the 945 articles retrieved from databases and journals, 93 articles were included in the analysis. Articles were coded based on the following five categories: functionality, data sources, design analysis, student perceptions, and measured effects. Based on this review, we need research on learning analytics reporting systems that targets the design and development process of reporting systems, not only the final products. This design and development process includes needs analyses, visual design analyses, information selection justifications, and student perception surveys. In addition, experiments to determine the effect of these systems on student behavior, achievement, and skills are needed to add to the small existing body of evidence. Furthermore, experimental studies should include usability tests and methodologies to examine student use of these systems, as these factors may affect experimental findings.

06aac54b-93fa-4f02-a10e-2d14dce1b62c,Design for excess capability to handle uncertain product requirements in a developing world setting,2017,"Products designed for the developing world often go unused or underused by the intended customers. One cause of this problem is uncertainty regarding the actual requirements of customers in the developing world. This can result when designers, with experience in technologically advanced countries, apply their own value structure to the products they design. Because of the designers’ lack of experience in the culture and environment of the developing world, the actual requirements are only partially known to them. This problem can be mitigated by (i) optimizing product flexibility and adaptability to react to uncertain requirements, and (ii) reducing the most critical uncertainties. The flexibility of a product to adapt to new or changing requirements has been shown to extend the service life of large complex engineered systems (e.g., aircraft carriers, aircraft, communication systems, and space craft). These systems must remain in service for extended periods of time, even though the environments and requirements may change dramatically. Applying these proven techniques to products designed for the developing world can alleviate the problem of uncertain requirements. This paper presents and demonstrates a technique aimed at improving the success of developing world engineering projects. Flexibility and adaptability minimize the impact of uncertainties, and are enabled by numerically optimized amounts of designed-in excess. A sensitivity analysis performed on the system model helps the designer prioritize the set of uncertain requirements and parameters for refinement. The technique is demonstrated in the design of a cookstove intended for use in the developing world. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",10.1007/s00163-017-0253-8

Particular attention will be devoted to define a proper mitigation scheme of the multi-gigabit transceivers embedded in the FPGA, which is a critical part of the LAr data acquisition chain.

This work reports a new configuration of this filter that can achieve extremely high Q values over a range of frequencies from very low to very high values. A typical value is Q = 2500, but can be even higher. These high values of Q can be obtained at very low frequencies, solving a long-standing problem for LC tank circuits. The new configuration consists of one voltage divider phase shift filter nested within a second such filter. A simulation is done to verify the accuracy of the theory and demonstrate the stability of Q with respect to circuit element value changes. One significant application of such a filter is in the creation of a tunable oscillator with a very high degree of spectral purity. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/MWSCAS.2017.8053032

The aircraft was built for the SAE Aero East Competition 2017 hosted in Lakeland, Florida. The objective is to design an all-electric aircraft optimized to carry as much weight as possible, while also minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft capable of successfully completing a flight circuit. A flight circuit is defined as flying completely around two safety cones for a total distance of about 726ft. The challenge has provided the team with the opportunity to improve design and manufacturing skills, while also gaining experience in real life engineering challenges. As a result, the team greatly increased their knowledge of aeronautical design and manufacturing. BYU-Idaho has developed a balsa/plywood carbon fiber reinforced fixed wing aircraft weighing approximately.7lbs, capable of carrying more than 4lbs. When configured for flight, its wings span 60in, and an overall length of 20.8in. Its wing can be broken down into three 20in segments. The aircraft is easily transported in a 6in diameter tube that is 20.3in in length. In order to maximize interior space and manufacturability, the fuselage was not streamlined. Aerodynamic advantages gained from streamlining were considered negligible. The three wing segments are made out of balsa wood ribs attached to a carbon fiber balsa wood composite spar. © Copyright 2017 SAE International.",10.4271/2017-01-6000

In this paper we demonstrate that a custom digital light processor stereolithographic (DLP-SLA) 3D printer and a specifically-designed, low cost, custom resin can readily achieve flow channel cross sections as small as 18 μm × 20 μm. Our 3D printer has a projected image plane resolution of 7.6 μm and uses a 385 nm LED, which dramatically increases the available selection of UV absorbers for resin formulation compared to 3D printers with 405 nm LEDs. Beginning with 20 candidate absorbers, we demonstrate the evaluation criteria and process flow required to develop a high-resolution resin. In doing so, we introduce a new mathematical model for characterizing the resin optical penetration depth based only on measurement of the absorber's molar absorptivity. Our final resin formulation uses 2-nitrophenyl phenyl sulfide (NPS) as the UV absorber. We also develop a novel channel narrowing technique that, together with the new resin and 3D printer resolution, enables small flow channel fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by fabricating 3D serpentine flow channels 41 mm long in a volume of only 0.12 mm3, and by printing high aspect ratio flow channels &lt;25 μm wide and 3 mm tall.

Nine subjects (5 male, 4 female) walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at 1.34 m/s for 120 s each while wearing a shoe that was instrumented with four NCPF sensors. GRF data, measured via the treadmill, and sensor data, measured via the NCPF inserts, were used in a tenfold cross validation process to calibrate a separate model for each individual. The calibration model estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with mean average errors (MAE) of 6.52 N (2.14%), 4.79 N (6.34%), and 15.4 N (2.15%), respectively. Two additional models were created using the sensor data from all subjects and subject demographics. A tenfold cross validation process for this combined data set resulted in models that estimated average anterior–posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with less than 8.16 N (2.41%), 6.63 N (7.37%), and 19.4 N (2.31%) errors, respectively. Intra-subject estimates based on the model had a higher accuracy than inter-subject estimates, likely due to the relatively small subject cohort used in creating the model. The novel NCPF sensors demonstrate the ability to accurately estimate 3D GRF during human movement outside of the traditional biomechanics laboratory setting. © 2017, Biomedical Engineering Society.",10.1007/s10439-017-1852-2

Evaporative coolers, an energy-efficient type of air conditioner used in dry climates, are a potential source of indoor endotoxins; however, this association is largely unstudied. We collected settled dust biannually from four locations in homes with evaporative coolers (n=18) and central air conditioners (n=22) in Utah County, Utah (USA), during winter (Jan-Apr) and summer (Aug-Sept), 2014. Dust samples (n=281) were analyzed by the Limulus amebocyte lysate test. Housing factors were measured by survey, and indoor temperature and relative humidity measures were collected during both seasons. Endotoxin concentrations (EU/mg) were significantly higher in homes with evaporative coolers from mattress and bedroom floor samples during both seasons. Endotoxin surface loads (EU/m2) were significantly higher in homes with evaporative coolers from mattress and bedroom floor samples during both seasons and in upholstered furniture during winter. For the nine significant season-by-location comparisons, EU/mg and EU/m2 were approximately three to six times greater in homes using evaporative coolers. A plausible explanation for these findings is that evaporative coolers serve as a reservoir and distribution system for Gram-negative bacteria or their cell wall components in homes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Second, for a 690 deg range of motion desired for each jaw, the bending stresses in the flexures are prohibitive considering materials used in current instruments. Third, for cables attached at fixed points on the mechanism, the mechanical advantage will vary considerably during actuation.

The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between cam morphology and dGEMRIC values, and to explore whether baseline dGEMRIC can predict the development of radiographic hip osteoarthritis. Methods Prospective cohort (SibKids) study with clinical, radiographic, and MRI assessment at baseline and five-year follow-up (n = 34). The dGEMRIC values of cartilage regions were correlated with measures of cam morphology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to baseline variables to predict radiographic loss of joint space width. Results Superolateral acetabular cartilage dGEMRIC values were significantly lower in participants with cam morphology (P < 0.001), defined as an alpha angle greater than 60°. There was a negative correlation between alpha angle and the dGEMRIC value of adjacent acetabular cartilage. This relationship was strongest superoanteriorly (r = −0.697 P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between baseline dGEMRIC and the magnitude of joint space width narrowing (r = 0.398 P = 0.030). ROC analysis of combined baseline variables (positive impingement test, alpha angle, dGEMRIC ratio) gave an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.75 for predicting joint space width narrowing greater than 0.5 mm within 5 years. Conclusions The size and position of cam morphology determines the severity and location of progressive cartilage damage, supporting the biomechanical aetiology of femoroacetabular impingement. Baseline dGEMRIC is able to predict the development of radiographic osteoarthritis.

Incorporating human knowledge in unsupervised learning is a promising approach to create high-quality topic models. Existing interactive systems and modeling algorithms support a wide range of refinement operations to express feedback. However, these systems’ interactions are primarily driven by algorithmic convenience, ignoring users who may lack expertise in topic modeling. To better understand how non-expert users understand, assess, and refine topics, we conducted two user studies—an in-person interview study and an online crowdsourced study. These studies demonstrate a disconnect between what non-expert users want and the complex, low-level operations that current interactive systems support. In particular, our findings include: (1) analysis of how non-expert users perceive topic models; (2) characterization of primary refinement operations expected by non-expert users and ordered by relative preference; (3) further evidence of the benefits of supporting users in directly refining a topic model; (4) design implications for future human-in-the-loop topic modeling interfaces. © 2017",10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.03.007

Results showed very clear differences between two broad classes of negative information: negative information about perceived physical facts (e.g. the presence of hazardous materials or dangerous conditions) as opposed to negative information about social relationships (e.g., a romantic breakup, the death of a loved one, or termination of employment). Participants consistently identified directness as a communicative virtue, even in contexts where they preferred a message format with a consistently small buffer in order to also satisfy a perceived need for politeness.

Multiple research groups have developed orthotic prototypes to low-pass filter tremor, but these devices have not yet been optimized for in-vivo use. Optimizing non-invasive tremor suppression requires an understanding of where the tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates to the hand (where it matters most). Here we present on the beginnings of our multi-pronged work to determine the origin, propagation, and distribution of Essential Tremor, and we provide preliminary results. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/ICORR.2017.8009242
eb99a4f0-7bf6-40b4-9d93-43a300d07d6a,Water entry of deformable spheres,2017,"When a rigid body collides with a liquid surface with sufficient velocity, it creates a splash curtain above the surface and entrains air behind the sphere, creating a cavity below the surface. While cavity dynamics has been studied for over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of deformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface impact, an elastomeric sphere deforms significantly, giving rise to large-scale material oscillations within the sphere resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high-speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behaviour of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres. Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period scales with the dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact hydrodynamic pressure. Therefore, we are able to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions. © 2017 Cambridge University PressÂ.",10.1017/jfm.2017.365
df2d5f8d-cf84-493f-b805-dc921523b2d3,Generating derivative superstructures for systems with high configurational freedom,2017,"Modeling alloys requires the exploration of all possible configurations of atoms. Additionally, modeling the thermal properties of materials requires knowledge of the possible ways of displacing the atoms. One solution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements is to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those that are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from a combinatorial explosion when the supercell size is large, when there are more than two atom types, or when there are many displaced atoms. This problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of unique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an existing algorithm to include the extra configurational degrees of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm uses group theory and a tree-like data structure to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the typical combinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously inaccessible cases, including atomic displacements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.04.015

The new method yields improved uncertainty in antenna efficiency measurements. Both methods are based on use of a reverberation chamber. Measurement results are compared to numerical simulations and good agreement (3% maximum difference) is achieved. Before performing the efficiency measurements, the chamber configuration was assessed with respect to the Rician $K$ -factor, number of uncorrelated paddle orientations, and coherence bandwidth. We calculated the uncertainty using the NIST microwave uncertainty framework capable of performing parallel sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses. The framework enables us to capture and propagate the uncertainties in the S-parameter measurements to the final efficiency result. The expanded uncertainty that we achieved for these antenna efficiency measurements is 2.60%. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2017.2708084

The joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the frequency offset, channel delays, and channel gains are derived and analyzed. As a complexity-reducing technique, a sequential version of the ML estimators is developed. The Cramér-Rao bound for the parameters is derived and used to analyze the performance of the estimators to determine pilot sequence length. The complexity of the frequency estimator is reduced by applying the Zoom FFT algorithm in the coarse search. The complexity of the channel delay estimator was reduced by developing a novel version of the simplex search algorithm that operated on a discrete two-dimensional grid.

The Alamouti space-time block code is used to encode the phase states in the complex exponential representation of SOQPSK-TG. Because SOQPSK-TG possesses memory, the Alamouti decoder is a sequence estimator. Maximum likelihood and least squares sequence decoders are derived. To reduce the number of states, the eight-waveform cross-correlated trellis-coded quadrature modulation (XTCQM) approximate representation of SOQPSK-TG is used. A prototype decoder based on the least squares decoder and the estimators described in Part I and operating at a data rate of 10 Mb/s was tested in the laboratory in test flights at the Air Force Test Center, Edwards AFB.

Depending on the materials on the advancing and retreating sides of the tool travel direction during FSW, four different material combinations are considered. FSW joints without macroscopic defects are successfully fabricated for the four different material combinations. The optical microscopy results show that the macroscopic material mixing behaviors of the two dissimilar material combinations during FSW are somewhat different from each other, even though the process responses during joining are not much different. The results of the quasi-static tensile tests and EBSD analysis demonstrate that the mechanical behaviors and orientation changes of the joint during tensile deformation are affected by the material locations with respect to the tool travel direction during FSW. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",10.1007/s12206-017-0742-8

The capability for multiple users to simultaneously model and design a CAD part has far-reaching potential. However, many basic questions remains unanswered, such as how many users should work together on a given part. This research proposes and develops a set of methods to determine the optimal number of users for a given part within a MUCAD environment, based on the characteristics of the part itself. Two candidate models are evaluated with a set of 60 experiments with design teams composed of different numbers of users. The models show modest correlations with the test data while more-refined models are explored to improve predictive power. On the other hand, highly significant correlations between the ability to predict completion time and multi-user team size were identified in the experimental data.

In this paper we demonstrate a method to detect leaks in the structural chamber of an inflatable, pneumatically actuated robot. We then show that our method can adaptively lower commanded joint stiffness which slows the mass flow rate of the leak. This extends the operational life of the robot by decreasing long term error during operation by as much as 50% of the steady state error at the end effector when compared to the same leak if our adaptation method is not used. In future applications where we expect soft, inflatable robots to be useful, our methods can enable failure mitigation in resource-limited situations such as space exploration or disaster response. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989687

The method described utilizes a multi-objective fitness function together with custom, platform-specific metrics related to the dexterity and load-bearing capacity of inflatable manipulators. Candidate designs are scored by computing these metrics at many randomly generated configurations and then by appropriately combining these scores within the multi-objective optimization framework. High performing designs are propagated through a genetic algorithm. The final result is a set of diverse, optimal designs lying along a Pareto front spanning the design space. By examining variations and trade-offs within this set, a designer can more appropriately choose design parameters for a target application.

During the optimization routine, the manipulator's base position and joint motions are planned simultaneously by strategically moving a set of virtual robot arms (each representing a single configuration in a sequence) branching from a common base to a number of assigned target poses associated with a task. Additional goals (e.g. collision avoidance) and hard constraints, including joint limits are also incorporated. The optimization problem at the core of this method is a quadratic program, allowing constrained high-dimensional problems to be solved in very little time.

The aircraft was built for the SAE Aero East Competition 2017 hosted in Lakeland, Florida. The objective is to design an all-electric aircraft optimized to carry as much weight as possible, while also minimizing the empty weight of the aircraft capable of successfully completing a flight circuit. A flight circuit is defined as flying completely around two safety cones for a total distance of about 726ft. The challenge has provided the team with the opportunity to improve design and manufacturing skills, while also gaining experience in real life engineering challenges. As a result, the team greatly increased their knowledge of aeronautical design and manufacturing. BYU-Idaho has developed a balsa/plywood carbon fiber reinforced fixed wing aircraft weighing approximately.7lbs, capable of carrying more than 4lbs. When configured for flight, its wings span 60in, and an overall length of 20.8in. Its wing can be broken down into three 20in segments. The aircraft is easily transported in a 6in diameter tube that is 20.3in in length. In order to maximize interior space and manufacturability, the fuselage was not streamlined. Aerodynamic advantages gained from streamlining were considered negligible.

Several methods exist to represent the codon bias of an organism: codon adaptation index (CAI) [1], individual codon usage (ICU), hidden stop codons (HSC) [2] and codon context (CC) [3]. These methods are often employed in the optimization of heterologous gene expression to increase the accuracy and rate of translation.

This scaffold was fabricated by coating vertically aligned carbon nanotubes in a highly conformal coating of nanocrystalline carbon, applied via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The coating increases the mechanical stability of the nanotube structure, which provides electrically conductive pathways through the anode. Silicon anodes were fabricated with the monoliths by low pressure chemical vapor infiltration of silicon. This platform allows the carbon and silicon volume fractions to be independently varied in the anode. Anodes with a low silicon content (less than 5% by volume) showed high stability in cycling against lithium with a capacity retention of 89.7% between cycles 2 and 185. Anodes with a high silicon content (∼25% by volume) showed poor capacity retention when the carbon content was low (<40% by volume), and transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the anodes failed due to the destruction of the nanocrystalline carbon coating during cycling. However, by increasing the carbon content to ∼60% volume percent in the monolith, capacity retention was substantially stabilized even for anodes with very high silicon loadings. These stabilized electrodes exhibited volumetric capacities as high as ∼1000 mA h/ml and retained over 725 mA h/ml by cycle 100. © 2017 American Vacuum Society.",10.1116/1.4984807

The course is part of an overall leadership framework whereby students are introduced to the importance of leadership as freshmen, learn foundational leadership principles as sophomores, and practice these principles as juniors and seniors. The leadership foundations course is required for graduation by 7 of 10 programs within the College of Engineering and Technology. Students external to the college also participate in the course as it fulfills two general education requirements for graduation. As a result, the college teaches approximately 12 sections each academic year averaging 60-80 students per section. Approximately 10-15% of student course participants are external to the college. In this paper a survey is presented of 163 students initially enrolled in the leadership foundations course regarding their perceptions and attitudes towards leadership. Results include a comparison of students who are required to take the course and those for whom it is optional. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups of students except for their expectation regarding workload. The engineering and technology students expected the leadership foundations course to be easier, relative to their other classes, than the nonengineering and technology group. In general, both sets of students had high expectations for the course and expressed positive attitudes towards learning about leadership. For example, students in both groups indicated they felt learning about leadership was somewhat more important than learning the skills of their discipline. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",

This shift in computing expectations focuses on the ability to compute horizontally, performing the same tasks within different computing environments, as opposed to vertically, performing different tasks in the same computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method by which the usability of a given piece of software can be comparatively analyzed across all hardware platforms on which it is available. This methodology is based on the Majrashi and Hamilton's twelve factors of usability and has been extended to include specific applications and metrics for the following computing platforms: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones. These metrics focus on collecting quantitative data about the usability of each platform. This quantitative data contrasts with recent studies which focus extensively on qualitative data regarding the user experience. Combining these two types of studies will allow researchers to capture a more comprehensive picture of software usability across computing platforms. The methodology has been validated by performing an initial study using the tasks and performance metrics across each of the defined computing platforms. The results from these initial tests have allowed us to make improvements to the testing methodology as well as some hypotheses for further testing. This proposed methodology, when used in conjunction with qualitative research, can provide a reliable approach for cross-platform usability analysis. Some considerations for educational design of cross platform methodology are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",

The main objective of this study is to construct fragility curves of typical non-skewed highway bridges in Chile. The fragility curves are obtained from an incremental dynamic analysis of a two-dimensional model of the bent cap of a two-span simply supported underpass. As most bridges are constructed with seismic tie-down bars, their constitutive behavior was obtained experimentally. A total of five seismic bar specimens were tested to characterize their cyclic behavior in bridges with and without transverse diaphragms. The incremental dynamic analysis was performed with the two horizontal components of seven seismic records obtained from the Mw 8.8, 2010 Chile earthquake. Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to assess the seismic behavior of bridges with different configurations of seismic bars, with lateral stoppers, and with varying length of the transverse seat width. Results from this study reveal that seismic bars have a limited contribution to the seismic performance of the studied bridge, especially when lateral stoppers are incorporated. Additionally, the transverse seat width is found to be critical to reduce the collapse probability of the superstructure. The provided fragility curves may be used for seismic risk assessment and to evaluate possible improvements in seismic bridge design codes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.03.041

The voltage gain of this stage can be maximised by operating the MOS devices in the moderate inversion region rather than the strong inversion region. In so doing, the voltage gains of the differential stage can reach values of over 120 dB and the power dissipation is minimised due to the low currents required. Harmonic distortion is also minimised by moderate inversion operation. Although the composite cascode or self-cascode has been successfully used as an op-amp differential stage, the conventional cascode differential circuit offers additional advantages and is compared to the composite cascode differential circuit in this work.

The method was developed for the U.S. Building Energy Asset Score, a whole-building energy efficiency rating system focusing on building envelope, mechanical systems, and lighting systems. The Asset Score is based on simulated energy use under standard operating conditions. Existing weather normalization methods such as those based on heating and cooling degrees days are not robust enough to adjust all climatic factors such as humidity and solar radiation. In this work, over 1000 sets of climate coefficients were developed to separately adjust building heating, cooling, and fan energy use at each weather station in the United States. This paper also presents a robust, standardized weather station mapping based on climate similarity rather than choosing the closest weather station. This proposed simulated-based climate adjustment was validated through testing on several hundreds of thousands of modeled buildings. Results indicated the developed climate coefficients can adjust the climate variations to enable a fair comparison of building energy efficiency. © 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s12273-016-0332-1

To develop an accurate and efficient methodology for this class of problems, we present algorithms for local h-adaptivity of hierarchical B-splines to be utilized in isogeometric analysis. We extend Bézier projection, an efficient quadrature-free local projection technique, to the hierarchical setting. In this case, extraction operators may not be invertible. To address this issue we develop a multi-level reconstruction operator which maintains the locality properties of the projection. We also introduce a balance parameter to control the overlap of hierarchical functions leading to improved numerical conditioning. We apply our algorithms to the simulation of localized prostate cancer growth. We model this disease using the phase-field method and a set of diffusion–reaction equations to account for the dynamics of nutrients and a key biomarker termed Prostate Specific Antigen. Our results include examples on simple 2D and 3D domains and a more compelling tissue-scale, patient-specific simulation, which is run over a prostate anatomy extracted from medical images.

Although the use of mechanical fasteners and adhesives have mostly paved the way for near-term implementation of dissimilar material systems, these processes only accentuate the need for low-cost welding processes capable of impartially joining dissimilar material components regardless of alloy, properties, or melting temperature. Friction stir scribe technology was developed to overcome the challenges of joining dissimilar material components where melting temperatures vary greatly, and properties and/or chemistry are not compatible with more traditional welding processes.

The design and implementation of these systems will be economically, transportationally, and environmentally important. In this paper, we use agent-based models to analyze the emergent behavior of several types of UAV systems with varying parameters and environments. We find that while increasing the number of UAVs initially has a more-than-linear effect on the reported separation incidents, this effect quickly levels off due to carrying capacity limitations. We also find that while different behaviors (objectives and movement patterns) of UAVs affects the locations of the separation incidents, the number of separation incidents is not strongly influenced by these changes. We then explore the implementation of separation-assurance mechanisms using varying levels of information, and examine effects on the emergent behavior. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/SYSCON.2017.7934789
72d8d346-2b9a-4a39-a5bb-af99e5075a0a,An RVE procedure for micromechanical prediction of mechanical behavior of dual-phase steel,2017,"A “bottom-up” representative volume element (RVE) for a dual phase steel was constructed based on measured microstructural properties (“microproperties”). This differs from the common procedure of inferring hypothetical microproperties by fitting to macroscopic behavior using an assumed micro-to-macrolaw. The bottom-up approach allows the assessment of the law itself by comparing RVE-predicted mechanical behavior with independent macroscopic measurements, thus revealing the nature of the controlling micromechanisms. An RVE for DP980 steel was constructed using actual microproperties. Finite element (FE) simulations of elastic-plastic transitions were compared with independent loading-unloading-loading and compression-tension experiments. Constitutive models of three types were utilized: 1) a standard continuum model, 2) a standard Crystal Plasticity (CP) model, and 3) a SuperDislocation (SD) model similar to CP but including the elastic interactions of discrete dislocations. These comparisons led to following conclusions: 1) While a constitutive model that ignores elastic interaction of defects can be fit to macroscopic or microscopic behavior, it cannot represent both accurately, 2) Elastic interactions among dislocations are the predominant source of nonlinearity in the nominally-elastic region (i.e. at stresses below the standard yield stress), and 3) Continuum stress inhomogeneity arising from the hard martensite / soft ferrite microstructure has a minor role in the observed transitional nonlinearity in the absence of discrete dislocation interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.msea.2017.04.032

Standard rib anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROWs) were fabricated with thin films of different intrinsic stress and indices of refraction. Buried ARROWs (bARROWs) with low and high refractive index differences between the core and cladding regions were also fabricated from the same types of PECVD films. All waveguides were subjected to a heated, high humidity environment and their optical throughput was tested over time. Due to water absorption in the SiO2 films, the optical throughput of all of the ARROWs decreased with time spent in the wet environment. The ARROWs with the lowest stress SiO2 had the slowest rate of throughput change. High index difference bARROWs showed no decrease in optical throughput after 40 days in the wet environment and are presented as a solution for environmentally stable waveguides made from unannealed PECVD SiO2. © 2017 IEEE.",10.1109/LPT.2017.2686354

Metered air bubbles controlled by microvalves are used to improve bead-solution mixing thereby enhancing the hybridization of the target Ebola virus RNA with capture probes bound to the beads. The method uses thermally stable 4-formyl benzamide functionalized (4FB) magnetic beads rather than streptavidin coated beads with a high density of capture probes to improve the target capture efficiency. Exploiting an on-chip concentration protocol in the SPM and the single molecule detection capability of the antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) biosensor chip, a detection limit of 0.021 pfu/mL for clinical samples is achieved without target amplification. This RNA target capture efficiency is two orders of magnitude higher than previous results using streptavidin beads and the limit of detection (LOD) improves 10×. The wide dynamic range of this technique covers the whole clinically applicable concentration range.

Given that 90% of storm outages in Connecticut are tree-related, accurate modeling of power outages before a storm arrives could result in improved pre-staging of crews and equipment resulting in improved electric reliability. The authors have generated a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data product that provides a 1-m resolution measurement of vegetation that is tall enough to strike overhead distribution powerlines, called “ProxPix”. These data, along with other vegetation management (e.g. tree trimming) and infrastructure data were evaluated for their improvement an outage prediction model over eastern Connecticut during Hurricane Sandy. A random forest model utilizing a repeated balanced sampling (RBS) approach with 10,000 iterations was used to evaluate which model forcing data accurately predicted the occurrence of a power outage in a 0.5 km grid cell. The authors found that models inputted with infrastructure, vegetation management, ProxPix, performed up to 5–13% better than simpler models depending on model evaluation criteria and input data; and that the model forced with utility infrastructure and ProxPix had the best overall performance. The ProxPix data created for this study have application to other research topics such as prioritizing areas for vegetation management near utilities and providing data on potential tree threats to roads, railways, or other infrastructure networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.epsr.2017.01.039

It uses measurement data to devise a family of reduced order nonlinear models while retaining physical interpretability of parameters and equations. The manifold boundary approximation method (MBAM) uses the Fisher information matrix calculated from measurements to identify the least relevant parameter combination in the original model. Next, it numerically constructs a geodesic on the corresponding statistical manifold originating from the initial parameters in the least relevant parameter direction until a manifold boundary is found. MBAM then identifies a limiting approximation in the mathematical form of the model and removes one parameter combination. The simplified model is recalibrated by fitting its behavior to that of the original model, and the process is repeated as appropriate. MBAM is demonstrated on the example of a synchronous generator (SG), which has been treated extensively in the literature. Implications of the proposed model reduction procedure on large power system models are illustrated on a 441-bus, 72-SG dynamical model. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2611511

Here, we rationally designed a pathology-targeted cell delivery strategy leveraging injectable micro-scaffolds as cell-loading capsule and endogenous tissue transglutaminase (TGase) at lesion site as adhesive. Up-regulated TGase post-liver injury catalyzed chemical bonding between the glutamine and lysine residues on liver surface and micro-scaffolds both ex vivo and in vivo, facilitating sufficient adhesion on the pathological liver. Upon intraperitoneal injection, Mesenchymal Stem Cell-loaded capsules, exhibiting cell protection from shear-induced damage and post-transplantation anoikis, adhered to the CCl4-treated liver with a hundred-fold improvement in targeting efficiency (70.72%) compared to free-cell injection, which dramatically improved mice survival (33.3% vs. 0% for free-cell therapy) even with low-dosage treatment.

The punch height versus load curve was found to be the same for temperatures of 25°C and for 50°C, whereas at 75°C and above, the load for a given punch height started to decrease, indicating a potential change in deformation mechanism. Electron backscatter diffraction was used to quantify features of the microstructure in the tested specimens. In particular, the gradual decrease in twinning activity as a result of easier thermally activated slip with increasing temperatures is quantified across this range.

These silks include the major and minor ampullate silks of the Nephila clavipes spider, and a synthetic spider silk fiber made from recombinant dragline silk proteins purified from transgenic goats’ milk. Two complementary measurement techniques are employed in the thermal characterization of these microscale single fibers for self-verification. One is the transient electrothermal technique (TET) and the other is the 3ω method. Experimental measurements indicate that thermal properties of the dragline silk are very close to those of the minor ampullate silk, whereas the ones for the synthetic silk are much lower due in part to its low crystallinity.

To clarify, optimally suppressing tremor requires a knowledge of the mechanical origin, propagation, and distribution of tremor throughout the upper limb. Here we present the first systematic investigation of how tremor propagates between the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist. We simulated tremor propagation using a linear, time-invariant, lumped-parameter model relating joint torques and the resulting joint displacements. The model focused on the seven main degrees of freedom from the shoulder to the wrist and included coupled joint inertia, damping, and stiffness. We deliberately implemented a simple model to focus first on the most basic effects. Simulating tremorogenic joint torque as a sinusoidal input, we used the model to establish fundamental principles describing how input parameters (torque location and frequency) and joint impedance (inertia, damping, and stiffness) affect tremor propagation.

We present and evaluate a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that are designed to allow a human to express intent by expressing desirable tradeoffs. The GUIs require an algorithm that identifies the set of Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective decision problem, which means that all the solutions are equally good in the sense that there are no other solutions better for every objective. Given the Pareto set, the GUIs provide different ways for a human to express intent by exploring tradeoffs between objectives; once a tradeoff is selected, the solution is chosen. The GUI designs are applied to interactive human-robot path-selection for a robot in an urban environment, but they can be applied to other tradeoff problems.

This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape. The team possesses a level of autonomy that allows the team to travel to and surround buildings of interest in a patrol and cordon scenario. During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to ""feel"" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload.

9a41f643-bd8a-4459-ba87-fa55460ff0e8,Overview of estimation methods for industrial dynamic systems,2017,"Measurement technology is advancing in the oil and gas industry. Factors such as wireless transmitters, reduced cost of measurement technology, and increased regulations that require active monitoring tend to increase the number of available measurements. There is a clear opportunity to distill the recent flood of measurements into relevant and actionable information. Common methods to do this include a filtered bias update, implicit dynamic feedback, Kalman filtering, and moving horizon estimation. The purpose of these techniques is to validate measurements and align imperfect mathematical models to the actual process. Additionally, they can determine a best-estimate of the current state of the process and any potential disturbances. These methods allow potential improvements in earlier detection of disturbances, process equipment faults, and improved state estimates for optimization and control. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/s11081-015-9295-9
bb5ea502-8d19-4c61-85fc-75939382ea6f,Reservoir sustainability and sediment management,2017,"Despite mounting demand for a more sustainable worldwide water supply system, available reservoir capacity is relentlessly diminishing due to sedimentation. Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available. By integrating these alternatives, economic analyses for reservoirs will be more accurate, reservoir life spans will be more sustainable, profits will be extended indefinitely, and the economic burdens placed on future generations will be lessened. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000720
7f5abeef-eeb8-4e8b-b501-45350f8cef29,Infrastructure Project Scope Definition Using Project Definition Rating Index,2017,"Front-end planning (FEP) is a critical process for uncovering project unknowns while also developing adequate scope definition and a structured approach for the project execution process. For infrastructure projects, the FEP process assists in identifying and mitigating risks stemming from issues such as right-of-way concerns, utility adjustments, environmental hazards, logistic problems, and permitting requirements. The authors have developed a novel risk management tool, called the project definition rating index (PDRI) for infrastructure projects, which can be used to identify and address these issues systematically and in a structured manner. Input from 64 industry professionals representing over 30 organizations was used in the development of the tool. In addition to a usable definition for infrastructure in the context of the built environment, a finite and specific list of issues related to scope definition of infrastructure projects was developed with this industry input. Data from 26 completed or in-process projects are given. Results show that the PDRI assessment score is indicative of the current level of scope definition for sample projects and corresponds to project performance. Findings support the hypothesis that projects with improved early understanding of scope definition elements showed improved project outcomes; infrastructure projects with low PDRI scores (well defined) outperformed projects with high PDRI scores. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by specifically identifying those FEP elements that are critical to infrastructure projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000483
198c01ea-8891-4720-bd07-263217c53f56,Evaluation of stochastic particle dispersion modeling in turbulent round jets,2017,"ODT (one-dimensional turbulence) simulations of particle-carrier gas interactions are performed in the jet flow configuration. Particles with different diameters are injected onto the centerline of a turbulent air jet. The particles are passive and do not impact the fluid phase. Their radial dispersion and axial velocities are obtained as functions of axial position. The time and length scales of the jet are varied through control of the jet exit velocity and nozzle diameter. Dispersion data at long times of flight for the nozzle diameter (7 mm), particle diameters (60 and 90 µm), and Reynolds numbers (10, 000–30, 000) are analyzed to obtain the Lagrangian particle dispersivity. Flow statistics of the ODT particle model are compared to experimental measurements. It is shown that the particle tracking method is capable of yielding Lagrangian prediction of the dispersive transport of particles in a round jet. In this paper, three particle-eddy interaction models (Type-I, -C, and -IC) are presented to examine the details of particle dispersion and particle-eddy interaction in jet flow. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2016.10.005

We evaluated point estimates and prediction intervals of outage predictions for both models using high-resolution weather, infrastructure, and land use data for 89 storm events (including hurricanes, blizzards, and thunderstorms). We found that spatially BART predicted more accurate point estimates than QRF. However, QRF produced better prediction intervals for high spatial resolutions (2-km grid cells and towns), while BART predictions aggregated to coarser resolutions (divisions and service territory) more effectively. We also found that the predictive accuracy was dependent on the season (e.g., tree-leaf condition, storm characteristics), and that the predictions were most accurate for winter storms. Given the merits of each individual model, we suggest that BART and QRF be implemented together to show the complete picture of a storm's potential impact on the electric distribution network, which would allow for a utility to make better decisions about allocating prestorm resources. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis",10.1111/risa.12652
c43809df-3e8c-403c-b054-da271361c6c2,"Strength, behavior, and failure mode of hollow concrete masonry constructed with mortars of different strengths",2017,"This study reports the failure modes of hollow concrete masonry prisms, taking into account the block and mortar stress-strain behavior. An extensive and detailed experimental program has been conducted on three-block high stack-bonded prisms, built using a combination of one hollow block type and three mortars with different strengths. Based on the results of the experiments, masonry failure was assessed. The main conclusion of this is that the mortar in all cases governs the masonry failure mechanism. The ratio between the masonry and block moduli of elasticity, which can be used as a measure of loss of stiffness, indicates that masonry built with a strong mortar behaves almost as a homogenous material. The typical failure mode observed during testing for this type of masonry was due to tensile stresses developed in the block. A crack developed at and propagated instantly through the block face until reaching the mortar bed joint; the crack then propagated through the head joint causing a localized split at the interface between block and mortar. For masonry built with two different weak mortars, as the stress/strength ratio increased, the ratio between the masonry and mortar moduli of elasticity decreased to 0.32 and 0.55, for the weak and the weaker mortar respectively. The observed failure mode, however, was independent of how weak the mortar was since, for both cases, the masonry failed due to localized mortar crushing. Another conclusion from the study presented herein is that a robust and reliable prediction of the masonry compressive strength requires the use of the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the component materials. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.12.112

The only hardware difference from a conventional μPIV setup is the placement of a microlens array at the intermediate image plane of the microscope. The method combines this optical hardware alteration with post-capture computation to enable 3D reconstruction of particle fields.

As the base material approached the probe, grains were compressed, forming compression zone (CPZ). The grains evolved to fine equiaxed grains mainly through discontinue dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and twining as it approached the tool. As material in MFZ rotated around the probe, the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) was reduced, the ratio of twin boundaries increased, and the grain size distribution became wider, while the average grain size was fairly constant despite the increase in strain. After the material was deposited behind the probe, the grains began to grow. Deformation caused by tool shoulder disrupted the twin boundaries and generated some segments of LAGBs. In the post-weld zone, some LAGBs disappeared and new twin boundaries developed as a result of elevated temperatures. The B component {112} 〈110〉 was developed and was sustained in the MFZ with its shear direction being consisted with the local probe rotation. The shear plan of B component maintained approximately 30 deg. away from the probe surface. In the weld zone behind the probe, the B component was weakened and evolved to a C component {001}〈110〉. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.matdes.2016.11.066

The Poynting power flux density vector associated with the field carries to the antenna the power dissipated in the antenna structure and the load. Streamlines of the Poynting vector field can be used to understand electromagnetic energy flow near linear and aperture antennas. Poynting streamlines provide a way to understand and guide the design of superdirective antennas. Directivity-enhancing screens that attract Poynting streamlines and increase the aperture efficiency of a horn antenna to almost 200% are studied. Superdirective antennas generally have limited practical value due to poor radiation efficiency, narrow bandwidth, and extreme sensitivity to fabrication errors. We show that these limitations can be mitigated by using metal-only structures that are optimized for broadband operation. The tradeoff between peak achievable aperture efficiency and bandwidth is explored. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TAP.2016.2632618

Generic building systems were studied with controlled factors such as number of buildings, equal-height vs. variable-height, skybridge connection type, site seismicity and wind intensity, and presence/absence of skybridges and atria. The 48 optimization problems held all other factors constant such as building width, shape, configuration, and spacing.

In the former, F→ 2 +, limit, the shallow water equations are formally approximated by a Korteweg-de Vries/Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KdV–KS) equation that is a singular perturbation of the standard Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation modeling horizontal shallow water flow. Our main analytical result is to rigorously validate this formal limit, showing that stability as F→ 2 + is equivalent to stability of the corresponding KdV–KS waves in the KdV limit. Together with recent results obtained for KdV–KS by Johnson–Noble–Rodrigues–Zumbrun and Barker, this gives not only the first rigorous verification of stability for any single viscous St. Venant roll wave, but a complete classification of stability in the weakly unstable limit. In the remainder of the paper, we investigate numerically and analytically the evolution of the stability diagram as Froude number increases to infinity. Notably, we find transition at around F= 2.3 from weakly unstable to different, large-F behavior, with stability determined by simple power-law relations. The latter stability criteria are potentially useful in hydraulic engineering applications, for which typically 2.5 ≤ F≤ 6.0. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/s00332-016-9333-6

Deposits of heavy fuel oil ash were created in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility (TADF) at Brigham Young University under gas turbine-related conditions. Ash was produced by burning heavy fuel oil in a downward-fired combustor and collecting the ash from the exhaust stream. The mass mean ash particle diameter from these tests was 33 microns. This ash was then introduced into the TADF and entrained in a hot gas flow that varied from 1088 to 1206°C. The gas and particle velocity was accelerated to over 200 m/s in these tests. This particle-laden hot gas stream then impinged on a nickel base superalloy metal coupon approximately 3 cm in diameter, and an ash deposit formed on the coupon. Sulfur dioxide was introduced to the system to achieve 1.1 mol% SO2 in the exhaust stream in order to simulate SO2 levels in turbines currently burning heavy fuel oil. The ash deposits were collected, and the capture efficiency, surface roughness, and deposit composition were measured. The deposits were then washed with deionized water, dried, and underwent the same analysis. It was found that, as the gas temperature increased, there was no effect on capture efficiency and the post-wash roughness of the samples decreased. Washing aided in the removal of sulfur, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Copyright © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/GT2017-63724

The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.",10.33012/2017.15158

Project-based learning is designed to provide students with an opportunity to engage in authentic problem finding and solving. Students often become very involved with the specifics of their project without always noticing what they are learning. As such, it becomes essential to engage them in reflection during the process and at the completion of the project. A constellation of formative and summative assessment activities that include self, group, and instructor, can aid the learner in this contemplation. We propose that public assessment in the form of a student-run sale can provide distinctive feedback to students. Our experience with student-run retail sales over multiple years has lead us to identify some unique characteristics of this type of public assessment. These include a positive effect on student motivation, independent validation in a face-to-face setting, and providing direct consumer feedback to students. In this paper we discuss assessment practice as it relates to the sale and review student reflections on the experience to determine its usefulness.",

This paper reviews the reframing of Brigham Young University’s third-year industrial design studio course to include training on IP. It appraises the current state of IP training in design schools and how design related IP has markedly shifted in recent years. It outlines basic IP exercises and introduces case studies for the four the primary types of IP: Copyrights, Trademarks, Design and Utility Patents. Students are exposed to two opposing mindsets regarding IP: the traditional position that views IP as a defensive tool to build a fence around an individual’s rights; and more importantly, how to use IP as a collaborative bridge between other market players enabling meaningful market offerings.",

When students are introduced to this framework, they are opened up to more flexibility in their design process and potential solutions. This paper outlines an industrial design student’s self-directed thesis project on encouraging self-compassionate thought patterns. We will examine how the process was affected by viewing the project as a multidisciplinary design field challenge instead of a traditional form, color and material-driven industrial design challenge. Importantly, the paper will discuss how research and design methods from industrial design, graphic design, interaction design, storytelling, and psychological science played into the creation of a meaningful designed project and experience. The paper concludes with several suggestions for integrating multidisciplinary design methods into classroom practice.",

A previously-developed semi-empirical shrub combustion model was improved and expanded to treat live chamise and big sagebrush. Fire spread in live chamise and big sagebrush shrubs was measured in an open-roofed wind tunnel, which was used as the basis to develop the current model. Shrub geometry was modeled by coupling a Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) approach with terrestrial LiDAR scan data. Wind speed was held constant at 1.4 m/s. Species specific correlations for physical properties and combustion characteristics of individual fuel element were incorporate in this model. Modeling results compared well with measured time-dependent fire behavior. Variations in local fuel density affected flame spread more than the overall fuel bed density. This model is an innovative approach to simulate shrub combustion via flame propagation at individual fuel element scale with a fairly low computational cost. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

da2eaa00-ad2a-4b2d-84c7-183c44303c8a,Investigation of merging flames in horizontal and vertical geometries,2017,"One of the main needs for accurate shrub combustion modeling is the complicated flame growth pattern due to merging of flames from multiple leaves and small branches. The interactions of neighboring flames have only been studied using regularly spaced fuel sources located on a horizontal plane. Flames in a burning shrub or tree merge to form large flames from fuel arrangements, which are not described by horizontal plane geometries. A careful study of flame interactions from fuels in three-dimensional arrangements is a necessary step in strengthening operational field models in complex fuel structures. The purpose of this research is to imitate the flame merging of the solid fuels in different geometries in order to describe fire behavior in complex fuel structures, such as trees or shrubs. Ceramic felt soaked in n-heptane were used as a fuel source to conduct flame-merging experiments. Flame characteristics such as flame length and flame width were measured for both single and merged flames. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute. All rights reserved.",
d98773bf-3d7a-4fc2-a9f2-cedd1679a75e,A comprehensive model for predicting elemental composition of coal pyrolysis products,2017,"Large-scale coal combustion simulations depend highly on the accuracy and utility of the physical submodels used to describe the various physical behaviors of the system. Coal combustion simulations depend on the particle physics to predict product compositions, temperatures, energy outputs, and other useful information. The focus of this paper is to improve the accuracy of devolatilization submodels, to be used in conjunction with other particle physics models. Many large simulations today rely on inaccurate assumptions about particle compositions, including that the volatiles that are released during pyrolysis are of the same elemental composition as the char particle. Another common assumption is that the char particle can be approximated by pure carbon. These assumptions will lead to inaccuracies in the overall simulation. There are many factors that influence pyrolysis product composition, including parent coal composition, pyrolysis conditions (including particle temperature history and heating rate), and others. All of these factors are incorporated into the correlations to predict the elemental composition of the major pyrolysis products, including coal tar, char, and light gases. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

In this work, a soot model was developed for coal systems that accommodates differences between solid fuel systems and gaseous systems, for which most traditional soot models are developed. The developed soot model contains terms for: particle nucleation based on tar evolution in a coal system, a nucle-ation mechanism based on the formation of PAH from gaseous species, gaseous interactions with particles (including: surface growth through HACA, particle oxidation/gasification), coagulation, and aggregation of existing particles. A monodispersed-particle size distribution form of this model can be used for cost-effective simulations, or for simulations with higher fidelity, the method of moments is used to transport higher moments of the particle size distribution. Validation work is presented, comparing numerically-derived soot values from the proposed model against measured soot concentrations in a flat-flame burner. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

18e0693e-b774-4938-b600-c9b41fb820e8,Pull-out strength of composite rebar made using a three-dimensional braiding machine,2017,"The objective of this research was to explore and demonstrate the production and performance of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar manufactured on a continuous three-dimensional braiding machine for use as reinforcement in concrete structures. FRP rebar is generally as strong as steel rebar, but less susceptible to corrosion, providing a significant advantage over traditional steel reinforcement in concrete structures. In this study, a variety of different design configurations of carbon/epoxy composite cylindrical rebar rods were manufactured, embedded in concrete, and tested in axial tension to identify the relationships between manufacturing parameters and tensile pull-out strength of the rebar. The rebar was produced by combining multiple tows of carbon/epoxy prepreg to form the core of cylindrical rods which were consolidated using various spirally-wound consolidation fibers. The rods were cured at 121 degrees Celsius as specified by the material manufacturer, TCR Composites. The manufactured rods were approximately 10.4 mm in diameter. Primary variables investigated included the consolidation fiber material (aramid, fiberglass and basalt), prepreg vs. dry consolidation tows, the number of tows used to consolidate the rebar (i.e., the size of tows used to consolidate the rebar). Larger consolidation tows were created by braiding three smaller tows together. The consolidation tows also served the purpose of providing the rebar with ribs similar to those on steel rebar to improve bonding. Select rebar samples were subsequently coated with sand to increase rebar surface roughness for improved bonding with concrete. The rebar was cast in 200 mm × 200 mm × 200 mm concrete cubes to investigate bond strength. The strength of the bond between concrete and FRP rebar was investigated using the pull-out test detailed by ACI 440.3R-12. A test fixture was manufactured to enable testing using a standard tensile testing machine. Standard 12.7 mm diameter steel rebar and a commercially comparable fiberglass rebar were also tested to provide baseline values. Results showed that the bond strength was below 344 MPa (50 ksi) when dry winding was used regardless of whether a single or a multiple tow consolidation bundle was used. Prepreg consolidation combined with sand resulted in a bond strength of 478 MPa (69.3 ksi), comparable to steel at 464 MPa (67.2 ksi). The results demonstrated that consolidating the rods with a wet tow resulted in a rebar which bonded better with concrete than using a dry tow. During testing, it was discovered that dry consolidating materials would easily strip off the rod due to poor bonding. Sand was shown to significantly increase the bond strength of the composite rebar, by more than 30 percent. This study provides the basis for a proposed new low-cost manufacturing method for composite rebar as structural reinforcement in concrete. These preliminary results allowed for a test matrix to be set up where FRP rebar bond strength could be investigated in detail using higher quality samples and more controlled parameters. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

The unique properties of discrete-time processing-aliasing due to resampling bandpass signals and polyphase filter decompositions- are applied to create a low-complexity approach that does not require any arithmetic operations at the IF sample rate. The required tasks are performed in two stages: a downsample-by-2 operation followed by a more traditional resampler based on a polyphase filterbank.,

Burning the understory every 2-4 years prevents fires from spreading to the canopy. However, combustion of live shrubs is not well understood, and has been shown to differ from combustion of dead biomass fuels. The purpose of this study is to investigate pyrolysis products from live shrub fuels. The pyrolysis products constitute the fuel for the gaseous flames in a fire. Amounts of pyrolyzed species depend on heating rate, temperature, fuel type, and fuel properties. In order to provide pyrolysis conditions and oxygen-free environment, a flat-flame burner (FFB) was designed and operated in a fuel-rich mode. Hot and cold traps were used to separate low and high molecular weight (tars) pyrolysis products and then analyzed in two different GC-MS systems. The data obtained help focus modeling efforts for combustion of live shrubs. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute. All rights reserved.",

Wildland fires can have necessary ecological influences in many North American ecosystems or can dangerously affect life, property and natural resources. These hazards decrease with the proper application of controlled burning. Controlled burning destroys smaller plants and also decreases combustible materials and the potential for ignition and fire propagation in the fuel bed. Fuel bed pyrolysis and ignition determine fire ignition and propagation rates in both wildland fires and prescribed burning, but the details of solid fuel reaction under wildland fire conditions remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to provide fundamental information about pyrolysis of live shrub fuels at slow heating rates. A programmable heater apparatus was used to study the pyrolysis products of three different kind of live shrubs from forests of the Southeastern United States. Low and high molecular weight pyrolysis products were collected in a cold trap and then analyzed using GC-MS.",

Literature review suggests that particle size and number density play a more critical role in determination of radiative properties than the complex index of refraction. Radiative data was produced from numerical experiments using one of two particle distribution profiles (narrow or wide). A comparison of highly forward scattering cases for two particle sizes (25μm vs. 75μm) revealed a significant difference in incident heat flux maximum (25%). This difference was observed in both profiles examined. It was also generally observed that as particle size increases the difference between incident heat flux for forward and backward scattering decreases. No significant difference was observed between the large diffuse sphere and no scattering cases, suggesting that accurate modelling of larger particle size distributions can be achieved while neglecting scattering and phase functions. This result agrees with current practice in industry for air - coal mixtures. However, data suggests that phase function/scattering coefficient influence becomes more and more important with increasingly fine particle size.",

The model was created using CPFD Software's Barracuda Virtual Reactor 17.2.0. The geometry of the feed system was simple and contained a vertical standpipe of five inches feeding into a horizontal pipe of twelve inches. The coal particles from the standpipe were transported into the reactor with gas. To ensure appropriate combustion in the reactor, the feed system needed to maintain both a steady flow rate of gas and solids in the pipe and uniform distribution of solids through the cross-section of the channel. Steadiness was determined by the mass flow rate of the coal leaving the feed system. Uniformity was assessed by plotting gas and particle velocities at the end of the channel. The uniformity and steadiness of the flow was assessed for different grid sizes, starting pressure and boundary conditions, and other parameters within Barracuda.",

The code calculates gas temperature and composition, wall heat flux, and wall and refractory temperatures using 1D, equilibrium chemistry and a 3D discrete ordinates radiation solver. Chemistry and temperature calculations are made for a discrete number of axial zones wherein the temperature and species composition are assumed to be uniform. Radiation calculations are performed on a finer grid and assume gray gases. The code was validated by comparing to experimental data obtained from the L1500 Multifuel Furnace. The experimental data were taken from a single oxy-coal combustion experiment with flue gas recirculation run at a firing rate of 880kW and an air-fuel ratio of 3.6. FENICS was able to qualitatively match the wall flux and temperature profiles quite well. The major exception to this being that peak flux cannot accurately be predicted due the assumptions utilized 'smearing' the flame. Quantitatively, FENICS showed good agreement with the data. Wall temperatures were accurate to within 150K (13%) while total wall radiative heat loss was within 4%. FENICS was also used to evaluate temperatue and flux profiles for a new pilot-scale oxy-coal reactor.",

When considering manufacturability of panels for origami-adapted products, there are tradeoffs between panel design approaches as well as thicknessaccommodation techniques. The use of bent sheet metal for panels shows promise as a panel design approach that mitigates several of these trade-offs. This paper describes a process that can be employed to use sheet metal in designs of origami-adapted mechanisms that utilize specific thickness-accommodation techniques. The process is demonstrated for a square-twist mechanism designed using the hinge shift technique for accommodating thickness in origami patterns. A Miura-ori mechanism is also shown in sheet metal. The characteristics of these bent panel approaches are discussed and compared to other approaches for designing panels for manufacturing. The use of bent sheet metal panels allows for mitigation of several trade-offs and shows the applicability of origami-adapted design to sheet metal. Copyright © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/DETC2017-68025

1844ef46-7152-4942-9278-cefb4f532945,Impact of computational mesh on CFD combustion predictions,2017,"This study has examined the impact of cell type and mesh refinement on predicted combustion results. Mesh refinement in regions of high velocity gradients was shown to be the most critical factor in achieving realistic simulation results. In Case 5 where mesh refinement was focused near the geometric shapes of the cooling tubes and burner tile, insufficient mesh refinement existed in the fuel-air mixing zones around and above the burner to accurately predict fuel jet penetration and fuel-air mixing, resulting in inaccurate predictions for flame shape and heat flux profiles at the cooling tubes. Differences in predicted incident flux, total heat transfer and flame shape between the highest levels of mesh refinement (~2 million cells) between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh were minimal. At lower mesh levels of 1 million cells, there were slightly greater discrepancies between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh, particularly with respect to the flame shape and upper furnace flux profile predicted in Case 3. Interestingly, the differences in thermal efficiency and total heat transfer were greater between Case 2 and Case 1 (2 million versus 1 million cells) than between Case 2 and Case 5 (2 million versus 1 million cells with poor refinement). This trend was also observed with Case 4 and Case 3. This suggests both cell count and local mesh refinement are important to achieving accurate combustion predictions, but that there is minimal difference between the results with differing mesh types as long as the cell count and refinement are sufficient to represent the expected jet mixing behavior. These results also suggest that while the flame shape does impact the boundary flux profile as expected, the impact on thermal efficiency may be less well correlated. Thus, total heat transfer results should not be used to assess flame shape behavior; boundary flux profiles provided better correlation to flame shape.",
e57eef9e-0189-4d45-a940-7676bd5bc64e,Thermal transport due to liquid jet impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces with isotropic slip,2017,"This paper presents an analytical investigation of thermal transport due to a steady, laminar, axisymmetric liquid jet impinging normally on a superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface maintained at constant surface temperature. At the liquid-surface boundary of the spreading thin film, an isotropic hydrodynamic slip and temperature jump are imposed to approximate the SHPo surface boundary condition. Applying an integral analysis within the thin film results in a system of differential equations which are solved numerically to obtain local hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thicknesses, thin film height, and local and radially averaged heat flux. The classical smooth hydrophobic scenario with no-slip and no-temperature jump showed excellent agreement with previous differential analysis of the same problem. The influence of varying temperature jump length on the local Nusselt number was obtained over a range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Increasing temperature jump length results in a dramatic decrease in the local thermal transport near the impingement point. The greatest decrease occurs at small temperature jump lengths. Further, local and average Nusselt numbers are less influenced by the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers as temperature jump length increases. Overall, variations in the temperature jump length exert much more influence than variations in the hydrodynamic slip length. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.03.044

Adiabatic, air-water mixtures were used to explore the influence of hydrophobicity on two-phase flows and the hydrodynamics which might be present in flow condensation environments. Pressure drop measurements in a rectangular channel with one superhydrophobic wall (cross-section approximately 0.37 × 10 mm) and three transparent hydrophilic walls were obtained. Data for air/water mixtures with superficial Reynolds numbers ranging from 22–215 and 55–220, respectively, were obtained for superhydrophobic surfaces with three different cavity fractions. Agreement between experimentally obtained two-phase pressure drop data and correlations in the literature for conventional smooth control surfaces was better than 20 percent, which is within the accuracy of the correlations. The data reveal a reduction in the pressure drop for two-phase flow in a channel with a single superhydrophobic wall compared to a control scenario.

8c1f76aa-915d-4343-bf3f-ddc89591aa69,Hydrodynamics of droplet impingement on hot surfaces of varying wettability,2017,"This work presents on the hydrodynamics of water droplet impingement on superheated solid surfaces across the entire wettability spectrum: superhydrophilic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic and superhydrophobic. While a large body of work exists on droplet impingement on hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, impingement on the latter two has been largely neglected and the present results show that dynamics are dramatically different. Experiments ranging in surface temperature from 125°C to 415°C and Weber numbers from 10 to 225 were performed and analyzed using high-speed imaging. Some of the most striking differences are as follows. While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a “pseudo-Leidenfrost” state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.12.076
f2cbf41b-a253-43e9-b20e-e50e10a70d18,Adding EUV reflectance to aluminum-coated mirrors for space-based observation,2017,"Protective layers on aluminum mirror surfaces which can be removed via the use of atomic hydrogen or hydrogen plasmas at the point of use in space may allow an expansion of broad-band mirrors into the EUV. LUVOIR (large, UV-optical-IR telescope) is a potential NASA flagship space-based observatory of the 2020's or 30's. It would utilize the largest mirrors ever flown1. Their reflective coating will almost certainly be aluminum, since such telescopes would profit from truly broad-band mirrors. To achieve reflectance over the broadest band, the top surface of such aluminum mirrors, however, needs to be bare, without the oxide layers that naturally form in air. This will open the 11 to 15 eV band. Since thin aluminum films are largely transparent between 15 and 70 eV an EUV mirror under the aluminum could make EUV bands such as 30.4 nm available for space-based astrophysics without sacrificing mirror IR, visible and UV reflectance. The local space environment for the observatory is sufficiently oxygen-free that the surface should remain bare for decades. We discuss protecting as-deposited aluminum mirrors with robust, oxygenimpenetrable, barrier layers applied in vacuo to the aluminum immediately after deposition and before air contact. The goal is that the barrier could also be cleanly, and relatively easily, removed once the mirror is in space. We propose hydrogen atoms as the means for removing the overcoat, since they can be expected to meet the criteria that the means is gentle enough to not roughen the mirror surface, and does not redeposit material on the mirror or other spacecraft components. We have investigated both organic and inorganic (such as, a-Si) hydrogen-removable films that can be applied to the aluminum immediately after its deposition have been investigated. We also examined the REVAP technique, using Cd and Zn. Agglomeration limited their effectiveness as barrier layers. That and dealing with the reevaporated atoms may limit their utility as barrier materials. © COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.",10.1117/12.2274694

In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

aa1cfb2b-64b4-44d9-bf2f-20d0db80e22e,Implementing highway safety manual life-cycle benefit–cost analysis of safety improvements,2017,"The Highway Safety Manual (HSM) lists four methods for determining the change in crash severity in order of reliability. The life-cycle benefit– cost analysis currently used by the Utah Department of Transportation is similar to the least reliable method. To provide a tool to perform the most reliable method defined by the HSM—the predictive method— this research developed a spreadsheet-based tool to allow department engineers to perform life-cycle benefit–cost analyses for the 11 roadway segment types included in the HSM. The tool can be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of safety-related improvements identified by the Utah crash prediction model, which was previously developed to identify safety hot spots on the state highway system. The concept and the spreadsheet layout are presented by using the rural two-lane, two-way highway spreadsheet as an example. Then a case of a rural two-lane, two-way highway with two selected countermeasures is presented to demonstrate the use of this spreadsheet to compare their benefit–cost ratios. One important aspect associated with life-cycle benefit–cost analyses of safety-related improvements is the cost of implementing such improvements. Safety-related improvements are often included in larger construction contracts and such costs vary significantly, depending on the way they are included in the larger contracts. Hence, construction costs of safety-related improvements—such as initial cost, periodic rehabilitation cost, and annual maintenance costs—must be prepared outside this spreadsheet by the user. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

45ef9495-9168-4e3e-940e-5eb6fb594c63,Implementation of lean practices among finishing contractors in the US,2017,"Many parties to the construction process have implemented lean construction practices to improve efficiency within their respective scopes of work. Academics have researched a wide range of these applications in an effort to assess barriers, benefits, and other associated impacts. One area of construction that is currently under-represented in lean literature is finishing contractors. The purpose of this paper was to assess lean implementation by finishing contractors in the US. 33% of the sample of contractors specializing in the finishing methods reported implementation of some level of lean practices. For those attempting lean, the most common tool being utilized was Last Planner System. The same group reported that implementation was driven by a desire to improve efficiency by cutting costs and reducing schedules. Non-practicing respondents indicated that the primary barrier to implementation was a lack of knowledge in the area.",10.24928/2017/0182

It is a multifaceted industry with unregulated transactions in which illicit behavior can be difficult to detect. The effects of corruption go beyond demoralization associated with bribery, it can lead to substandard quality of infrastructure and insufficient funds available for project maintenance. There are a multitude of reasons identified as possible causes for unethical conduct. A few researchers cited corruption as a result of an unethical decision. Prior research concerning corruption in construction has called for several main strategies: enhanced transparency, ethical codes, project governance, and audit and information technology. However, strategies to combat corruption may not be sufficient. This research first presents an overview of unethical conduct in the industry. Then it examines the ethics in the industry followed by types of relationships and their structure which may be conducive to unethical conduct within the framework of different delivery methods. Finally, an argument is made regarding the importance of strength of relationships in curbing unethical conduct.",10.24928/2017/0213

What is needed are descriptors capable of describing distortion profiles with both high and low distortion content and account for the reshaping of distortion profiles. Four key parameters were identified as desirable to quantitatively capture distortion transfer, generation and effects on performance: distortion magnitude, shape, severity and phase. A set of distortion descriptors based on Fourier analysis are shown to quantitatively capture distortion magnitude, shape and phase change across bladerows. These Fourier descriptors are modal amplitude, total amplitude, and phase shift. When used together, these Fourier descriptors can be used to qualitatively describe any conceivable profile shape for any parameter. Copyright © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/GT2017-65031
17d77751-29d4-48b7-9b2c-0abf1bd2e554,Improved bottomhole pressure control with wired drillpipe and physics-based models,2017,"Wired Drillpipe (WDP) technology provides two-way and high speed measurements from bottom hole and along-string sensors. The data offered by WDP technology has maximum benefit when applied in an automation system or as a real-time advisory tool. Improved control is demonstrated for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with the use of high-speed telemetry and physics-based models. Stabilizing and minimizing pressure within an acceptable bound leads to higher and more consistent Rate of Penetration (ROP). MPD control is challenging due to tight pressure windows and the nonlinearity of the choke and pump response on Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP). This work demonstrates a new Hammerstein-Wiener nonlinear model predictive controller for BHP regulation in drilling. Hammerstein-Wiener models employ input and output static nonlinear blocks before and after linear dynamics blocks and thereby simplify the controller design. The control performance is evaluated in scenarios such as drilling, pipe connections, and kick attenuation. A physics-based drilling simulator, WeMod, is used for model identification and control performance evaluation. The control performance of the new nonlinear controller is compared to conventional controllers in various scenarios. Because of the interconnected multivariable and nonlinear nature of the drilling operation, conventional controllers show severe limitations. In a first scenario, the performance of set point tracking during normal drilling operation is compared. By changing the set point of the BHP, the conventional controller manipulates only the choke valve opening while the nonlinear controller moves choke valve opening, mud pump, and back pressure pump simultaneously. In a second scenario, a pipe connection of a typical drillpipe stand is demonstrated. The conventional controller is not able to regulate the BHP by adjusting the choke valve only. Although a linear version of the controller is able to exploit multivariable relationships, absence of the nonlinear relationships results in severe oscillation when the operational range is shifted outside of the training region. The nonlinear controller maintains a BHP within ±1 bar of the requested set point. A third scenario investigates the kick attenuation performance of conventional and nonlinear control algorithms. The nonlinear controller attenuates the kick within well control conditions, without requiring a well shut-in procedure. Recent advances in drilling simulators and the reliability of the WDP data highway have enabled tighter BHP control. This study presents a robust method to control BHP by applying Hammerstein-Wiener models in an efficient model predictive controller. The proposed methods have been validated in the downstream industry, but are applied for the first time to drilling with nonlinear control functionality. The multivariable control adjusts three main manipulated variables in MPD simultaneously. Copyright © 2017, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition.",10.2118/184610-ms

In that time two processes have been developed, the External Cooling Loop and Compressed Flue Gas Cryogenic Carbon Capture processes (CCC ECL™ and CCC CFG™ respectively). The CCC ECL™ process has been scaled up to a 1 TPD CO2 system. In this process the flue gas is cooled by an external refrigerant loop. SES has tested CCC ECL™ on real flue gas slip streams from subbituminous coal, bituminous coal, biomass, natural gas, shredded tires, and municipal waste fuels at field sites that include utility power stations, heating plants, cement kilns, and pilot-scale research reactors. The CO2 concentrations from these tests ranged from 5 to 22% on a dry basis. CO2 capture ranged from 95-99+% during these tests. Several other condensable species were also captured including NO2, SO2 and PMxx at 95+%. NO was also captured at a modest rate. The CCC CFG™ process has been scaled up to a.25 ton per day system.

Current wind farms are generally built with turbines that are all the same height, but if wind farms included turbines with different tower heights, the cost of energy may be reduced. We used gradient-based optimization to demonstrate a method to optimize wind farms with varied hub heights. Our study includes a modified version of the FLORIS wake model that accommodates three-dimensional wakes integrated with a tower structural model. Our purpose was to design a process to minimize the cost of energy of a wind farm through layout optimization and varying turbine hub heights. Results indicate that when a farm is optimized for layout and height with two separate height groups, COE can be lowered by as much as 5-9%, compared to a similar layout and height optimization where all the towers are the same. The COE has the best improvement in farms with high turbine density and low wind shear exponent. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

One of the most challenging earthquake-related hazards in the design of large infrastructure is liquefaction-induced lateral spread displacement. This paper presents a new simplified probabilistic approach to estimate lateral spread displacements at targeted return periods across large geographic areas using performance-based lateral spread displacement reference parameter maps and (if available) site-specific geotechnical information. The approach is demonstrated on a hypothetical pipeline extending from Rock Springs, Wyoming, to West Bountiful, Utah, in the United States. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed. The results of the demonstrative calculation show how the approach can be used to identify areas where additional geotechnical investigations might be needed, and how probabilistic lateral spread displacements can be easily predicted along numerous proposed alignments of the pipeline once geotechnical subsurface investigation and ground surveys become available. © 2017 ASCE.",10.1061/9780784480724.051

The SYBAfeature descriptor is a robust algorithm that performs well with different degrees of image variation including: illumination, blurring, rotation, and perspective variations. The first step in detecting moving objects is to find the absolute difference between two image frames. To find the difference, the homography that describes the geometric relationship between the two frames is calculated using matched image feature points. The homography is then used to transform and align the images accurately. The transformed images are then used to calculate the absolute difference of the two images. It is then visually apparent where objects have moved or changed between the two images. Frame-to-frame object movement can be approximated to a linear process making the Kalman filter algorithm the best option. Once an object is lost, its corresponding track is deleted along with its corresponding motion model. During tracking, an object may be occluded by other objects in the scene. The MOT metric is designed to evaluate the performance of an object tracker by considering the tracking continuity, distance error for each path, and the reliability of detection. Thus, only the position of the object is considered in generating the MOT metric. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method and prove that the SYBA descriptor works well with various image deformations.",10.2514/1.I010503

The goal of this study was to better understand this behavior for abutments backfilled with both gravel and geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). Large-scale testing was performed with non-skewed and 30° skewed abutment configurations. Two tests were performed at each skew angle, one with gravel backfill and one with GRS backfill. The test abutment backwall was 3.35 m wide, non-skewed, and 1.68 m high and loaded laterally into the backfill. Both backfills exhibited greater passive resistance than sand backfills owing to increased internal friction angle and unit weight. Skew angle reduced the passive force in both cases by about 40%. The GRS backfills had reduced initial stiffness and only reached 79% to 87% of the passive force developed by the unreinforced gravel backfill. This reduction was considered to be a result of reduced interface friction at the geotextile-backwall interface due to wrapping. Reduced stiffness may be favorable for abutment configurations because it allows thermal movement without developing excessive induced stresses in the bridge superstructure. © ASCE.",10.1061/9780784480458.003
1fe6d3df-e714-402a-8f46-4fac5b6f28af,Ash deposition during advanced oxy-coal combustion using minimum recycled flue gas,2017,"Research on oxy-coal combustion has heretofore primarily focused on retrofit, or near retrofit, applications, where flame temperatures or heat transfer profiles under oxy-firing are similar to those under air firing. These profiles are modulated using recycled flue gas that acts as the diluent normally served by nitrogen during air firing. The large amounts of recycled flue gas (RFG) required leads to efficiency losses, making the economics of this process less attractive. Oxy-coal combustion economics can be improved in advanced oxy-combustion processes that may involve zero or minimal RFG and possibly high combustion pressures. This paper addresses effects of high combustion temperatures resulting from minimal RFG, on ash aerosol formation and ash deposition mechanisms. Issues related to ash deposition play important roles in being able to predict overall boiler performance. Effects of high pressure will be reported in future work. A 100kW downfired laboratory combustor is used to compare ash aerosol formation and deposition under two conditions: 1) using 27% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY27), representing first generation oxy-combustion (heat transfer conditions similar to air firing for retrofit); 2) with 70% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70), representing advanced oxy-combustion where the RFG is used only to transport the coal, not to modulate flame temperatures. The ash aerosol particle size distributions and its size segregated composition were determined using on-line electric mobility/light scattering analyzers and low pressure impactors, respectively. Their relationship to ash deposition rates as determined using a specially designed deposition probe was explored. The data show that, compared to the retrofit conditions of OXY27, the advanced oxy-coal combustion in OXY70 produce much higher concentrations of submicron particles due to increased mineral vaporization at the high flame temperature and the decreased flue gas flow rate. This appeared to lead to significant increases in deposition rates. Changes in the supermicron particle concentration were in line with those expected by the lower flue gas alone, suggesting that mineral fragmentation is not greatly affected by temperature. Deposition rates of both inside and outside deposits, as defined in earlier work, are interpreted in the light of recently developed hypotheses that point to the importance of the submicron particle ash concentration. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

GTR-STBC equipped with MMSE equalizer performs the best trade-offbetween the signal-tonoise ratio and inter-symbol interference by allocating unequal power over aeronautical telemetry channels. However, aeronautical telemetry channels are in general consists of larger delay spreads which make the MMSE equalization of aeronautical channels with GTR-STBC computationally complex. Interestingly enough, in spite of larger delays aeronautical channels are made of few sparsely distributed multipaths and therefore their MMSE equalizers are highly compressible. In this paper, compressed sensing based greedy algorithm is used for the design of sparse MMSE equalizer and a convex curve-fitting algorithm is used to find the sub-optimum power allocation parameter at the same sparsity level for GTR-STBC. Our simulation results show that 75-90% of the non-zero equalizer taps can be reduced with a slight relaxation of the mean-squared error (or equivalently slight degradation of bit-error rate performance). It is also observed that the optimum transmitter power profile for the sparse MMSE equalizer is different than that of the non-sparse equalizer.",

This detailed physics-based model includes two particle-size distributions: that for soot particles and for soot precursor molecules.

Validation work is presented comparing experimental results for a coal flame and biomass gasifier against model predicted values for soot concentrations and size distributions.

Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive combustor simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. A recent sensitivity analysis of a detailed char conversion model (Char Conversion Kinetics (CCK)) found thermal annealing to be an extremely sensitive submodel. In the present work, further analysis of the previous annealing model revealed significant disagreement with numerous data sets from experiments performed after that annealing model was developed. The annealing model was accordingly extended to reflect experimentally observed reactivity loss due to thermal annealing of a variety of coals in diverse char preparation conditions. The model extension was informed by a Bayesian calibration analysis. Additionally, because oxy-fuel conditions include extraordinarily high levels of CO2, development of a first-ever CO2 reactivity loss model due to annealing is presented.",

Little is known concerning the Coanda effect as it pertains to flame attachment in relation to wildfires. There is a need for improvement in the correlations between fire behavior on or near a slope and fire safety zones. An understanding of this effect could lead to more reliable guidelines for the establishment of firefighter safety zones, which are regions in wildfire areas that have been determined as safe for the survival of the firefighter. This paper discusses the ability of two commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes (Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and STAR-CCM+) to model the results of actual flame experiments near barren slopes. Simulation results were compared to measured values of flame attachment length and radiative and convective heat fluxes. Pressure and temperature gradient measurements along the slope are reported. Proper modeling of small-scale experiments with such software packages can lead to more confidence in large scale simulations and eventual development of firefighter safety zones in wildfires.",

Nanostructured platinum (Pt) catalyst was deposited onto the CNTs with a facile, electroless deposition method, resulting in a Pt-nanowire-coated, CNT sensor (PN-CNT). Convective mass transfer enhancement was shown to improve PN-CNT sensor performance in the non‐enzymatic, amperometric sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In particular, convective enhancement was achieved through the use of high surface area to fluid volume structures and concentration boundary layer confinement in a channel. Stir speed and sensor orientation especially influenced the measured current in stirred environments for sensors with through-channel diameters of 16 μm. Through-flow sensing produced drastically higher signals than stirred sensing with over 90% of the H2O2being oxidized as it passed through the PN-CNT sensor, even for low concentrations in the range of 50 nM to 500 μM. This effective utilization of the analyte in detection demonstrates the utility of exploiting convection in electrochemical sensing.

ebd42e7d-0631-4a7f-8f2b-853dbc1f77e1,Automatic model calibration for drilling automation,2017,"Physics-based hydraulic models are essential for proceeding to a high level of automation in drilling. Mathematical models can facilitate process understanding and problem detection, and determine appropriate actions in case of mismatch between model and data. Furthermore, calculations may replace measurements where and when the latter are not available, as normally occurs during connections or when instruments or signal transmissions fail. However, advanced hydraulic models rely on a large set of inputs, such as pipe and wellbore geometry, various tuning parameters and fluid properties. The models are therefore time-consuming and difficult to configure in the field, where third-party experts may be needed at each well, to properly initiate the automation system and adjust it during the drilling process. Although the methods described in this paper are relevant to any critical drilling operation, they are applied to Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) as a widely deployed example of drilling automation. In MPD, hydraulic models predict downhole conditions and determine the requisite choke pressure for automatic adjustment. A new method for automatic configuration of key model parameters simplifies the tedious job of setting up the model and ensures that the automation system remains tuned to the well, even without onsite model tuning expertise. The proposed scheme is based on a simple method for separating inaccuracies due to co-linearity in frictional pressure losses and static mud weight. The search for optimal correction factors is based on a sequence of small oscillations of pump rate that can be applied during drilling without interrupting the operation. A massively parallel computing architecture improves the speed of the calibration algorithm proportional to the number of available CPU cores. A set of hydraulic model instances runs in parallel, allowing for efficient testing of changes in input signals within ranges of uncertainty. A method for selecting a subset of the best models that more accurately represent a given well is proposed. Computer simulations demonstrate how the novel calibration scheme allows automatic tuning of the friction factor and density correction factor, giving accurate prediction of the bottom hole pressure (BHP). The tuning scheme is run with a parallel architecture to demonstrate that correct values of unknown configuration parameters can be automatically determined sufficiently fast for real-time drilling control or as an advisory tool. The deployment of automation systems in drilling is hampered by the need for dedicated expert personnel to maintain systems that could have reduced the personnel needed on the rig. The proposed automated physics-based model tuning contributes to removing this roadblock, aiming at making automation systems a more cost-efficient option for drilling operations.

c7b4c229-8e3a-4b65-af18-94850c51d26a,Acoustic shock formation in noise propagation during ground run-up operations of military aircraft,2017,"A distinctive feature of many propagating, high-amplitude jet noise waveforms is the presence of acoustic shocks. Metrics indicative of shock presence, specifically the skewness of the time derivative of the waveform, the average steepening factor, and a new wavelet-based metric called the shock energy fraction (SEF), are used to quantify the strength and prevalence of acoustic shocks within waveforms recorded 10-305 m from a tethered military aircraft. The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, while the ASF and SEF tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at engine conditions ranging from 50% to 150% engine thrust request, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay, the metrics point to continued nonlinear propagation in the far-field, out to 305 m. Many of these features are accurately characterized using a nonlinear propagation scheme based on the Burgers equation, but this scheme fails to account for multipath interference and significant atmospheric effects over the long propagation distances, resulting in an overestimation of nonlinearity metrics. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

dc480dd8-1f6e-4b18-ac47-8da451380000,Level-educed wavepacket representation of Mach 1.8 laboratory-scale jet noise,2017,"The search for an equivalent acoustic source model for high-speed jet noise has recently focused on wavepacket representations. A wavepacket is defined as a spatially extended source with an axial amplitude distribution that grows, saturates and decays, an axial phase relationship that produces directional noise, and correlation lengths longer than the integral length scales of the turbulent structures. This definition of a wavepacket has the same characteristics as the large-scale turbulent mixing noise; if the turbulent mixing noise can be isolated, the associate equivalent acoustic wavepacket—defined as a pressure fluctuation on a cylinder around the jet nozzle—can be found. An estimate of the frequencydependent, spatial variation in the large-scale turbulent mixing noise comes from a similarity spectra decomposition of the measured autospectral density, which in turn leads to data-educed wavenumber axial spectra associated with the frequency-dependent equivalent wavepackets. This wavepacket eduction technique has been applied to acoustical measurements of an unheated, Mach 1.8 jet in the near and far fields. At both locations, the resulting frequency-dependent, data-educed wavenumber spectra exhibit different types of self-similarity for low and high frequency regimes that become apparent when the axial wavenumber is scaled by the acoustic wavenumber, with a transition band between the two regimes. As expected, the data-educed wavenumber spectra can be used to predict field levels in the dominant radiation lobe. Addition of an uncorrelated source distribution, derived from the similarity spectra decomposition associated with the fine-scale turbulent mixing noise, creates a model that accounts for the sideline levels. This field-prediction ability of the wavepacket-plus-uncorrelated-distribution model is tested using the near and far field measurements. When predicting the field at the other location, the model’s average error is less than 2 dB for St = 0.04-0.25 but increases for larger St because the apparent directivity changes from near to far field, likely due to the frequency dependence of the extended source region. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

bf5ac866-8ce2-4a06-b422-4ea3f9fe91df,Beamforming-based wavepacket model for noise environment predictions of tactical aircraft,2017,"Jet noise consists of extended, partially correlated sources such that a single-wavepacket source representation is inadequate. A multiple-wavepacket (MWP) model provides an analytical framework for jet-noise-like radiation to simulate jet noise field levels as well as the corresponding spatial coherence properties within the field. Here, a beamforming method with regularization is applied to noise measured by a linear array near a high-performance military aircraft. Beamforming results are decomposed into a reduced-order MWP model and the predicted radiation is validated in terms of level and coherence properties using benchmark measurements. Sound levels and coherence lengths generated by the beamforming results show good agreement with benchmark measurements over a range of frequencies that contribute significantly to the overall radiation. The MWP model is shown to predict full-scale specific features such as multilobe directivity patterns, and the addition of an uncorrelated distribution (UD) model adequately predicts the sideline radiation that is otherwise difficult to reproduce from wavepacket radiation. The MWP model predicted radiation characteristics are an improvement over single-wavepacket models, which do not incorporate spatiotemporal features of the radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Because of the ability to unwrap the phase of the transfer functions between microphone pairs in the measurement of a radiating, broadband source, physically meaningful near-field intensity vectors are calculated up to the maximum analysis frequency of 32 kHz. The new intensity method is used to obtain a detailed description of the sound energy flow near the jet. The resulting intensity vectors have been used with a ray-tracing technique to identify the dominant source region over a broad range of frequencies. Additional aeroacoustics analyses provide insight into the frequency-dependent characteristics of jet noise radiation, including the nature of the hydrodynamic field and the transition between the principal lobe and sideline radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This understanding has been enhanced with acoustic imaging technologies, such as near-field acoustical holography (NAH). In this study, multisource statistically optimized NAH (M-SONAH) was used to image the sound field near a tethered F-35 aircraft at multiple frequencies. A linear microphone array, placed along the ground, spanned the length of the jet exhaust plume. A multisource model of the sound field was included in the algorithm to incorporate the effects of the ground reflection on the measurement. Narrowband reconstructions elucidated fine details of the radiation patterns, such as multilobe radiation patterns (which may supersede “dual-lobe” patterns shown in previous studies), and broadband shock-associated noise.

Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated, evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured from CI-CNTs. However, a major challenge for CI-CNT stent designs is meeting the design requirement of sufficient radial force. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",10.1007/978-3-319-45387-3_10
feec3431-7006-4e08-b217-995f4f634f55,Effect of leader placement on robotic swarm control,2017,"Human control of a robotic swarm entails selecting a few influential leaders who can steer the collective efficiently and robustly. However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge. Finally, closer analysis of leader placement and coverage reveals that front leaders within the swarm tend to expand their coverage and move towards the center as the maneuver is performed. Results from this study are expected to inform leader placement strategies towards more effective human swarm interaction systems. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

The compressible material is typically expanded polystyrene or geofoam. Little guidance is available on the development of passive force with an inclusion. To explore this issue, large-scale passive force tests were conducted with and without a geofoam inclusion acting as a barrier between the backfill soil and a simulated bridge abutment. The presence of the geofoam inclusion reduced the passive force by 70% relative to the sand backfill alone. Although the measured force and failure geometry appeared to conform to a log-spiral mechanism when only sand backfill was used, the geofoam inclusion transforms the failure geometry to a Rankine failure mechanism. This suggests that the geofoam acted to reduce the interface friction between the wall and the backfill sand thereby reducing the passive resistance. © ASCE.",10.1061/9780784480465.007

Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. In particular, comprehensive char oxidation and gasification models have been developed that describe multiple reaction and diffusion processes. This work extends a comprehensive char conversion code (CCK), which treats surface oxidation and gasification reactions as well as the processes such as film diffusion, pore diffusion, ash encapsulation, and annealing. In this work several submodels in the CCK code were updated with more realistic physics or otherwise extended to function in oxycoal conditions. Improved submodels include the annealing model, the swelling model, the mode of burning parameter, and the kinetic model, as well as the addition of the Chemical Percolation Devolatilization (CPD) model.

f440279d-0471-46d3-8b79-6b1889fe5145,Towards a universal social impact metric for engineered products that alleviate poverty,2017,"More than ever before, engineers are creating products for developing countries. One of the purposes of these products is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no established method of measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics to assess their product's impact, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper we introduce a potential metric, the Product Impact Metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: Health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. The PIM is inspired by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme. The MPI measures how the depth of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's quality of life changes after being affected by an engineered product. The Product Impact Metric can be used to predict social impacts (using personas that represent real individuals) or measure social impacts (using specific data from products introduced into the market). © 2017 ASME.",10.1115/DETC201767584

Details of the project and field operations are provided, and comparisons are made between induced settlement measurements from traditional techniques and induced settlement measurements from the new sUAV/SfM approach. Results of the study show that the sUAV/SfM approach estimates an average induced settlement of 38 cm across the site, which straddles within 2.5 cm of the average induced settlements that were measured with other traditional techniques. Additionally, the sUAV/SfM technique is shown to provide significant detail of the distribution of induced settlements across the site. This distribution of settlements could be indicative of the distribution of subsurface soils that were more affected by the DDC such as looser or cleaner sands.

Current methods to accomplish this have prohibitively long lead times due to extensive sample preparation. This work details the use of quantum dots thermomarkers to measure the surface temperature of thin fibers in a non-contact manner and determine the fibers’ thermal diffusivity. Neural networks are trained on extracting the temperature of a sample from fluorescence spectra in calibrated, steady-state conditions, based on different spectral features such as peak intensity and peak wavelength. The trained neural networks are then used to reconstruct the evolution of the surface temperature in transient heating experiments. In order to determine the thermal properties of a thin fiber, modulated laser heating is applied and an FFT-based method is used to extract the phase and amplitude response of the temperature field at the modulation frequency. The spatiotemporal dependence of the fluorescence signal, obtained by scanning the distance between the excitation and detection laser spots and varying the frequency response due to an axial scan and a frequency scan, is then curve-fit to the resulting decay curves by a photothermal model in order to determine the thermal diffusivity of the fiber. The measured thermal diffusivity (3.3 ± 0.8 × 10−7 m2 s−1) of a synthetic spider silk fiber by the current method has similar properties to other synthetic silk fibers, and demonstrates the ability of the current method to more rapidly measure thermophysical properties of thin fibers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.05.046

Surface strains were measured using a digital image correlation method in order to ensure that biaxial stretching was achieved. The punch height versus load curve was found to be the same for temperatures of 25 and for 50, °C, while at 75, °C the load for a given punch height was less. This difference seems to indicate a change in deformation mechanism between 50 and 75, °C. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify features of the microstructure in the as-received and the strained specimens. Rather than a sudden transition from twinning to slip at low temperatures, it appears that twinning gradually decreases and slip activity increases as temperatures rise across the range from 25 to 125, °C. This confirms recent predictions found in the literature. The twin activity predominantly involves the formation of compression twins which rapidly transform further to create secondary twins for easier strain accommodation. © 2017, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",10.1007/978-3-319-52392-7_91

As such, it is a useful representation for complex networks where a coarse description of global system structure is desired without detailing the intricacies of a full state realization. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a minimal state realization for a given dynamical structure function. Interestingly, some dynamical structure functions require uncontrollable modes in their state realizations to deliver the desired input-output behavior while respecting a specified system structure. As a result, the minimal order necessary to realize a particular dynamical structure function may be greater than that necessary to realize its associated transfer function. Although finding a minimal realization for a given dynamical structure function is difficult in general, we present a straightforward procedure here that works for a simplified class of systems. © 2014 IEEE.",10.1109/TCNS.2015.2498468

Nanorod attachment to DNA origami was via DNA hybridization for Au and by electrostatic interaction for Te. Electroless gold plating was used to create nanoscale metal—semiconductor interfaces by filling the gaps between Au and Te nanorods.

Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods.

The moderately hydrophobic drug latanoprost was rapidly loaded in 4 min by swelling contact lenses in a solution of the drug in n-propanol. A fraction of the drug was radiolabeled, thus allowing measurement of the uptake and subsequent release of drug into artificial tear fluid. Three questions were addressed: (1) how much drug can be loaded into each type of lens, (2) how fast is drug release, and (3) how are these values related to the contact lens chemistry. The results showed that much more latanoprost could be loaded into SiHy lenses than a conventional contact lens of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The drug uptake correlated with the amount of swelling in n-propanol, with Galyfilcon lenses having the greatest swelling and highest drug uptake. The drug release from the SiHy lenses occurred over days, whereas the conventional lens released nearly all drug in a burst over a few hours. To examine correlations between lens chemistry, drug chemistry and uptake, and solvent chemistry, the Hansen solubility parameters were calculated using estimates of contact lens chemistry. These results showed that drug uptake in SiHy lenses correlated with favorable solubility parameter interactions between the n-propanol and the lens material, but did not correlate with interactions between the drug and the lens materials. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1wrJe09kgE/-456409
7db47b71-674e-4a17-8918-8cfa289c69f3,Rethinking Our Assumptions About Language Model Evaluation- again but new,2021,"Many applications of pre-trained language models use their learned internal representations, also known as word- or sentence embeddings, as input features for other language-based tasks. Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or ‘reasoning in the linguistic domain’. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",nmgdQjerop/-456409
93b82090-f9e8-4a5e-829f-d10a9963cd1a,On the effects of channel sparsity on joint estimators in aeronautical telemetry- again but new,2021,"Minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizers are a viable solution to mitigate the frequency selectivity of the aeronautical telemetry channel. Because the MMSE equalizer filter coefficients are a function of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), the equivalent discrete-time channel, and the noise variance, reliable estimates of those parameters are required. The CFO is due primarily to the high velocity of the airborne transmitter. Because the equivalent discrete-time channel in aeronautical telemetry is sparse, the performance of the joint estimator based on a sparse channel estimator is superior to the performance of a traditional nonsparse maximum-likelihood-inspired joint estimator. The improvement is seen in lower estimator error variances for the parameters, particularly for the CFO and channel estimate, and in the postequalizer bit-error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the postequalizer bit-error rate using the sparse estimator is almost as good as that using ideal estimators. © 1965-2011 IEEE.",qE6gl8BIYu/-456409

In this letter, we provide a decentralized routing algorithm for coordinating multiple autonomous vehicles as they visit a discrete set of pre-defined targets with weighted revisit priorities. The algorithm utilizes a block coordinate ascent algorithm combined with a Monte Carlo tree search to tractably decide each vehicle's route. The result is a non-myopic algorithm for multiple vehicles that is decentralized, computationally tractable, and allows for target prioritization. Guarantees are provided that all targets will have finite revisit times and that the block coordinate ascent algorithm will converge to a block optimal solution. Numerical simulations illustrate the utility of this method by showing that the results are comparable to those of a centralized exhaustive search and that they degrade gracefully with limited communication and scale under increasing numbers of targets and vehicles. © 2016 IEEE.",S5qGtbJpKF/-456409

Adaptive methods which restore symmetry to the relay test are developed, and additional methods are presented to detect and recover from a non-oscillation condition. This is demonstrated both in simulation and in a process with significant transients and disturbances — friction stir welding (FSW). In testing, it is shown that the adaptive method is able to restore symmetry even in the presence of severe and changing disturbances, including after the weld plunge where temperature gradients change rapidly.

In this work, an experimental prototype of this concept is realized and its performance is analyzed. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of maintaining a spacecraft component at a desired operating temperature through the expansion and contraction of a collapsible radiator to control radiative heat loss. Four aluminum panels are connected via a flexible hinge constructed from interwoven copper wires and suspended from an actuating framework. The radiator panels are connected to a heated aluminum block. The radiator is placed in a vacuum environment with cooled surroundings (173 K) and the total radiative cooling power is determined as a function of radiator actuation position for a constant aluminum block temperature. As the radiator actuates from extended to collapsed, the heat transfer decreases and the fin efficiency increases. For a limited actuation range, the four-panel radiator exhibits a turn-down ratio (largest cooling power / smallest cooling power) of 1.31. A numerical model validated in this work predicts a turn-down ratio of 2.27 for actuation over the full range of radiator positions in surroundings at 4 K. Future revisions that exhibit an increase in panel and hinge thermal conductivities and utilizing eight panels would yield a turn-down ratio of 6.01. Assuming infinite thermal conductivity and infinite hinge conductance, the turn-down ratios for two, four and eight panel radiators, respectively, are 2.00, 3.98, and 7.92. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",glizPkEiey/-456409

For this purpose, ODT is extended in two ways. First, a forcing scheme that maintains statistical stationarity is introduced. Unlike direct numerical simulation (DNS) of forced turbulence, the ODT framework accommodates forcing that is not directly coupled to the momentum equation. For given forcing the ODT energy dissipation rate is therefore the same in particle-laden cases as in the corresponding single-phase reference case. Second, previously implemented one-way-coupled particle phenomenology is extended to two-way coupling using the general ODT methodology for flow modulation through interaction with any specified energy and momentum sources and sinks. As in a DNS comparison case for Reλ=70, turbulence modulation is diagnosed primarily on the basis of the fluid-phase kinetic-energy spectrum. Because ODT involves subprocesses with straightforward physical interpretations, the ODT mechanisms of particle-induced turbulence modulation are clearly identified and they are plausibly relevant to particle-laden Navier-Stokes turbulence. ODT results for the ratio of particle-phase and fluid-phase kinetic energies as a function of particle Stokes number and mass loading are reported for the purpose of testing these predictions in the future when these quantities are evaluated experimentally or using DNS. © 2020 authors.

Of all the components of a bridge, the bridge deck typically deteriorates most quickly and must therefore be regularly inspected for non-visible internal cracking, called delamination, for which early detection and repair can enhance safety and performance as well as reduce long-term maintenance costs. This research demonstrates the development and deployment of a multi-channel acoustic impact-echo sounding apparatus equipped with specially-configured tire chains for acoustic excitation of the concrete, microphones, an array of sensors for establishing spatial position estimates, and a data processing architecture for accurately detecting and mapping delaminations in concrete bridge decks at high speeds.

Experimental bicrystals can be difficult or expensive to fabricate, and computational constraints limit atomistic bicrystal simulations to high-symmetry GBs (i.e., those with small enough GB periodicity). Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structure–property models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structure–property models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structure–property model is unknown. We present an idealized case study in which GB structure–property models for diffusivity are inferred from noisy simulation results of two-dimensional microstructures, under the assumption that the number of polycrystal measurements available is larger than the number of parameters in the inferred model. We also demonstrate how uncertainty quantification for the inferred structure–property models is easily performed within this framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",S31hY8v60t/-456409

Additionally, we examine the roles of technological turbulence and environmental dynamic capability. We have administered a cross-sectional (time lag) survey design with 229 respondents from 31 manufacturing organisations in Malaysia and employed the partial least square path modelling (SmartPLS3) for data analysis. Results indicate that technological turbulence, green recruitment and selection and green training, involvement and development are positive predictors of green team creativity. Green performance and compensation negatively predict green team creativity. While green team creativity positively predicts green product innovation, environmental dynamic capability negatively predicts green product innovation. Technological turbulence reinforces the positive impact of green recruitment and selection on green team creativity and dampens the positive impact of green training, involvement and development on green team creativity. Furthermore, green team creativity is a complementary and competitive mediator. By simultaneously investigating the predictive powers of technological turbulence, green team creativity and environmental dynamic capability in our study, we offer novel insights that extend traditional HRM conceptualisations to reflect a more environmentally sustainable GHRM framework.

No fatalities were reported, but the earthquake caused widespread power outages, structural damage to residential buildings, damage to roadways and railways, and ground failures. This paper presents a summary of preliminary findings by the NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) team. Damage was characterized using a combination of on-ground site mapping and aerial reconnaissance with state-of-art geomatics technology and photogrammetry. Recorded peak ground accelerations (PGA) at most stations range between 0.2 g and 0.3 g, with a few sites in the central and southeastern vicinities of Anchorage with PGA greater than 0.5 g. The duration of strong shaking from the M 7.1 event may not have been enough to initiate substantial movements on the majority of the historic landslides from the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake, including the slides at the Turnagain Heights and 4th Avenue. However, liquefaction appeared to have contributed to re-mobilization of the 1964 Potter Hill (Rabbit Creek) landslide.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L∕W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties. © 2020 by John Salmon.

The moderating role of operational failures- again but new,2021,"Hospital providers often use workarounds to circumvent processes so that patients can receive care. Workarounds in response to operational failures enable care to continue and therefore may be indicative of workers' commitment. On the other hand, workarounds in the absence of operational failures may signal an ineffective approach associated with lower quality of care and worse patient outcomes. Working closely with healthcare providers, we developed a survey to measure workaround behaviors and operational failures on medical/surgical units. The lead author surveyed over 4,000 nurses from 63 hospitals throughout the United States. We matched this data with audit data on the incidence of pressure injuries among over 21,000 patients on 262 nursing units in 56 survey hospitals. Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are a significant risk to patient health and hospital costs. We do not find support for our hypothesis that workarounds are associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. However, when we take into account the moderating role of operational failures on the relationship between workarounds and pressure injuries, we find significant results. When nursing units have lower levels of operational failures, workarounds are associated with higher rates of hospital-acquired pressure injuries. Our results provide evidence that workarounds may be associated with negative patient outcomes, if they stem from a process-avoiding approach. The best results can be achieved by reducing both operational failures and workarounds via instilling a process-focused approach. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",AAv6SXBjDq/-456409

The nonlinear parameter extracted in NRUS is based on the dependence of the resonance frequency on vibration amplitude in the presence of damage. NRUS measurements typically are excited with a piezoelectric transducer, but here the application of an electromagnetic transducer is explored as an alternative. The electromagnetic transducer, unlike a single piezoelectric, allows selective excitation of longitudinal, torsional, and bending vibrations in a rod-shaped sample. Measurement of the nonlinear properties of the sample for each type of vibration is therefore possible. This electromagnetic technique involves gluing a coil of wire onto the end of a rod sample and placing it in a magnetic field. By controlling which part of the coil is inside the strongest region of the magnetic field, the principal direction of the driven oscillations in the rod can be controlled. Both piezoelectric and electromagnetic excitation techniques are tested by measuring the parameter of nonlinearity for longitudinal motion, αE, in a sample of Berea sandstone.

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting. (iii) For free-slip boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC is bounded from above by, where is the shear Reynolds number, with a scaling exponent smaller than the anticipated. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic focusing was implemented in 10-μm scale microchannel cross-sections made with a single sacrificial layer. HDF is achieved using buffer fluid to sheath the sample fluid, requiring four fluid ports to operate by pressure driven flow. A low-pressure chamber, or pit, formed by etching into a substrate, enables volumetric flow ratio-induced focusing at a low flow velocity. The single layer design simplifies surface micromachining and improves device yield by 1.56 times over previous work. The focusing design was integrated with optical waveguides and used in order to analyze fluorescent signals from beads in fluid flow. The implementation of the focusing scheme was found to narrow the distribution of bead velocity and fluorescent signal, giving rise to 33% more consistent signal.

Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model. As a model problem, we consider the dynamic response of the energetic molecular crystal, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (or RDX), under dynamic compression induced by simulated flyer plate impact experiments. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",lFRRKu38lj/-456409

The method uses a multilevel framework called relative navigation and visual-inertial odometry: Both of which have been used for singlevehicle GPS-denied navigation. This work modifies the relative navigation architecture by adding the necessary elements to enable decentralized, cooperative operations. The proposed framework also includes the ability to incorporate intervehicle measurements and uses a new concept called the coordinated reset, which is necessary for optimizing the cooperative odometry and improving localization. A simple communication protocol is presented, as well as flight-test results that show its effectiveness. The method is first demonstrated in simulation, including Monte Carlo testing, to show the expected improvement gained from cooperation. Finally, results from hardware testing are presented that show the ability of the system to reject initialization errors, to operate with temporary communications dropouts, and to greatly reduce the total amount of shared data compared to a naive approach. The proposed method is able to improve both global navigation accuracy and the accuracy of the relative aircraft positions for missions that require formation flying. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This technology enables different individuals and companies across the globe to share 3D model data in more direct ways. However, intellectual property becomes a larger issue when sharing potentially sensitive data with others in real-time. Partitioning techniques are one strategy to mitigate this risk within multi-user CAD environments. This study explores and evaluates six different partitioning techniques across various metrics identified in the literature and performed a user study to assess the methods' capabilities to hide or suppress data from others. Best practices are suggested and survey data from the participants are analyzed. Overall, the Planar Decomposition technique was found to offer the best trade between protecting data, facilitating multi-user design, and encouraging users to focus only on the relevant information for a design activity. © 2020 CAD Solutions, LLC.",yNRwcaWxRt/-456409
758503c9-b236-4f15-90ee-594b8ec3be9f,Visio-acoustic data fusion for structural health monitoring applications- again but new,2021,"Structural health monitoring has been an expanding discipline due to its potential to decrease maintenance and downtime costs, detect failure early, extend life spans, and fulfill the increased need of safety and security. Acoustic source identification techniques’ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniques’ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements. Experiments are conducted to show how combining acoustic and video data relaxes the hardware requirements for acoustic source detection and localization applications. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",NFwOjGLTza/-456409
80156453-bdca-4f35-b017-1151ea7fb279,On the modeling of a contact-aided cross-axis flexural pivot- again but new,2021,"This paper reports the study of a planar Cross-Axis Flexural Pivot (CAFP) comprising an additional contact pair. The proposed device may be useful for applications requiring a revolute joint that behaves differently when deflecting clockwise/anti-clockwise. The presence of the contact pair reduces the free length of one flexures, resulting in a considerable increment of the overall joint stiffness. The pivot behaviour is investigated, for different load cases, via the Chained-Beam-Constraint Model (CBCM), namely an accurate method to be applied in large deflection problems. A framework comprising Matlab and ANSYS is developed for testing the CAFP performances in terms of rotational stiffness, parasitic shift and maximum stress, with different combinations of geometrical aspect ratios and contact extensions. Results achieved via CBCM for a pure rotation applied to the CAFP's output link are then verified through Finite Element Analysis. The resulting performance maps show good agreement between the numerical results. Furthermore, the CBCM shows an improved computational efficiency, which is a crucial aspect for preliminary design steps. At last, direct comparison between simulations and experiments, developed by means of two custom test rigs, confirms the efficacy of the proposed design method for the modeling of contacts in large deflection problems. © 2019",i3DyXjalv4/-456409

The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated. The present study offers a parametric nonlinear lateral force-displacement backbone curve for BATBs that is verified against three-dimensional finite-element models and validated against data from large-scale tests conducted at Brigham Young University. The parametric curve takes backwall height as well as abutment skew angle into account. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0VZYRVWSdC/-456409
644b5ae7-bb99-4ec2-b530-65e032829eaf,An iterative pose estimation algorithm based on epipolar geometry with application to multi-target tracking- again but new,2021,"This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating the relative pose of a moving camera using consecutive frames of a video sequence. State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware. We show application of our algorithm to visual multi-target tracking (MTT) in the presence of parallax and demonstrate its real-time performance on a 640 480 video sequence captured on a UAV. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.",JHJFo7pxUq/-456409

While there is significant research regarding user motivation on dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder, and Match.com, there is no published research that discusses the motivations of Mutual app users. Developed as a dating app to target members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mutual allows users to find potential mates who share their religious background and specify their relationship readiness (from “Into Dating I Guess” to “Ready for a Ring”). This research aims to illuminate the various motivations, attitudes, and opinions of Mutual app users through Q methodology, which identifies perceptual groups among homogeneous populations through a factor analysis of participants’ agreement with similar statements regarding Mutual use. Findings indicated four factor groups: the Relationship Readies (i.e., those serious about dating), the Swipeaholics (i.e., those looking for entertainment), the Faithless (i.e., those who felt pressured to use Mutual), and the Eligible Optimists (i.e., those who saw the app as a convenient, entertaining way to date). Different from other research on dating apps, this study indicates that people may use a niche religion-focused dating app to find individuals with similar moral values or due to external pressure from others.

By structuring the container of a thermal vapor with narrow emission apertures, the velocity distribution can be modified to create a directed beam of atoms.1 These atomic beams can then interact sequentially with a series of optical fields, or interaction zones, and ultimately allow precision control over the internal state of the atom. This is useful for optical frequency standards and precision spectroscopy2, 3 and may also provide the means to build a simple flying qubit platform.4 Furthermore, atomic beams on a chip can be used as a compact, directed source to load magneto-optical traps (MOTs) while minimally increasing the ambient pressure.5 We apply microfabrication techniques to microscopically structure silicon to deterministically control the ow of Rb between connected cavities. We describe a methodology to measure the experimental parameters that govern the flux of atomic vapors in these microfabricated structures with a goal of creating an equivalent electrical circuit model.

Of the most widely used energy harvesters, piezoelectric generators can generate more electric charge than their triboelectric counterparts with similar device size, thus are more suitable to make compact wearable devices. However, most high-power piezoelectric generators are made from lead zirconate titanate, making them undesirable for wearable applications due to the toxic lead element. In this study, a flexible piezoelectric generator (F-PEG) is fabricated with chemically stable and biocompatible Group-III-nitride (III-N) thin film by a layer-transfer method. The III-N thin-film F-PEG can generate an open-circuit voltage of 50 V, a short-circuit current of 15 µA, and a maximum power of 167 µW at a load resistance of 5 MΩ. Applications of the III-N thin-film F-PEG are demonstrated by directly powering electronics such as light-emitting diodes and electric watches, and by charging commercial capacitors and batteries to operate an optical pulse sensor. Furthermore, the III-N thin-film F-PEG shows good durability and a stable output after being subjected to severe buckling tests of over 30,000 cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",HTi5vUJ3ih/-456409

Our approach significantly reduces the amount of density functional theory (DFT) calculations needed, resorting to DFT only to produce the training data, while structural optimization is performed using the interatomic potentials. Our approach is not limited to one (or a small number of) lattice types (as is the case for cluster expansion, for example) and can predict structures with lattice types not present in the training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by predicting the convex hull for the following three systems: Cu-Pd, Co-Nb-V, and Al-Ni-Ti. Our method is three to four orders of magnitude faster than conventional high-throughput DFT calculations and explores a wider range of materials space. In all three systems, we found unreported stable structures compared to the AFLOW database. Because our method is much cheaper and explores much more of materials space than high-throughput methods or cluster expansion, and because our interatomic potentials have a systematically improvable accuracy compared to empirical potentials such as embedded atom model, it will have a significant impact in the discovery of new alloy phases, particularly those with three or more components. © 2018",8tj5o9QkGP/-456409

Each interaction is analyzed to determine properties that affect the likelihood of transmission, reflection, or absorption of the dislocation at the GB of interest. The results confirm the ability to predict the slip system of a transmitted dislocation using common geometric criteria. Furthermore, machine learning reveals that geometric properties, such as the minimum residual Burgers vector (RBV) and the disorientation angle between the two grains, are strong indicators of whether or not a dislocation will transmit through a GB. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",PtJDlfIZZY/-456409

Often, ground-truth video of the activity is recorded along with sensor-data recorded during the activity. The data must be synchronized with the recorded video to be useful. In this paper, we present and compare two labeling frameworks that each has a different approach to synchronization. Approach A uses time-stamped visual indicators positioned on the data loggers. The approach results in accurate synchronization between video and data but adds more overhead and is not practical when using multiple sensors, subjects, and cameras simultaneously. Also, synchronization needs to be redone for each recording session. Approach B uses Real-Time Clocks (RTCs) on the devices for synchronization, which is less accurate but has several advantages: multiple subjects can be recorded on various cameras, it becomes easier to collect more data, and synchronization only needs to be done once across multiple recording sessions. Therefore, it is easier to collect more data which increases the probability of capturing an unusual activity.

For all aluminas, heat treatment results in decreased surface area and increased pore diameter. Starting at 700 °C, metastable to stable phase transformation occurs, causing a substantial change in the pore structure of all aluminas. By 1100 (PA), 1200 (15 SDA) and 1200 °C (27 SDA), the transition to α-Al2O3 was complete, respectively. No α-Al2O3 is observed for 5 wt % silica doped alumina (5SDA) under thermal calcination. Calcination in steam and air, instead of in air only, results in enlarged pore size and depressed temperature of alpha phase transformation for all aluminas. Results show that the silica dopant modifies the pores of the alumina, stabilizes the oxygen lattice of γ-Al2O3, and retards α-Al2O3 formation. This study of the thermal and hydrothermal stability not only suggests the applicability of 5SDA for catalytic reactions occurring at high temperature in the presence of steam, but also contributes to a better understanding of the structural features responsible for the improved thermal stability of these aluminas. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",cZdOsIm280/-456409

Further, by collecting one observation every 12 minutes, rather than a subgroup of five every hour, the time-weighted charts of individual values result in a shorter ATS (average time to signal) than would be possible using Shewhart charts of subgrouped data. This article explores a similar strategy of monitoring process variability using time-weighted control charts and individual observations. The average time to signal a change in variability using these charts is studied when there are targets or known values for the in-control process mean and standard deviation. The results show that the ATS of both the Cusum and EWMA are substantially shorter than the ATS for the standard R charts or the more efficient S2 chart using subgroups of 5. The article also describes how the control limits for the EWMA chart to monitor process variability should be modified if the in-control process mean and standard deviations are unknown and must be estimated from a Phase I study.

However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesium’s high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (λ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars. Information gathered from this study could be useful in creating more complex or finer micro-structures on magnesium and its alloys to alter their wetting or corrosion characteristics using laser ablation which is a fast, repeatable and an un-convoluted process.

985cafc6-7a11-45ae-8c02-9464546c66f2,"Exploring the moral differences, between industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship students- again but new",2022,"Over the last two years our industrial design programme has been involved in a number of interdisciplinary team projects. We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of one’s moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an “essential skill for workers in the coming decades” (Colombo and Grilli, 2005). © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

The overall information is obtained by combining SCADA-and phasor measurement unit-derived data, where time stamping (based on Global Positioning System or an equivalent local clock) for all measurements is assumed. Based on simulations performed in communication Network Simulator 2, empirical cumulative distribution functions can be associated with transfer times of measurement packets, which will reflect communication parameters and irregularities. This is further used to form an algorithm which maximizes the number of successful network observability checks, and thus the number of possible state estimations, in a certain time period. Application is demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus test power system example. © 2019 IEEE.",HuiLoZMqFb/-456409

A usability study of the authentication ceremony of secure messaging applications- again but new",2022,"The effective security provided by secure messaging applications depends heavily on users completing an authentication ceremony-a sequence of manual operations enabling users to verify they are indeed communicating with one another. Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances. We conclude by exploring user threat models, finding significant gaps in user awareness and understanding. © 2017 by The USENIX Association. All rights reserved.",C4dla8wZq7/-456409
4cde51cd-4dc8-4e25-aa38-fb2f4a98d8af,Identifying Team Selection and Alignment Factors by Delivery Method for Transportation Projects- again but new,2022,"One critical antecedent to project success is team alignment. Industry professionals should focus on practices that can improve project team selection, team building, and identifying challenges to the team and project, hence improving alignment. This paper provides a summary of key findings of a national study of transportation projects, identifying current practices of industry professionals for the selection and alignment of project teams for transportation projects. Current team selection practices, the most beneficial team alignment practices, and the greatest challenges to team alignment are identified in the study. These practices are also analyzed and reported by project delivery method, and the results presented in this paper add to the body of knowledge by identifying current alignment practices, successful practices, and challenges specific to each delivery method. Among the findings are that overall project teams are selected primarily based on project experience and ability to meet schedule, regardless of the project delivery method chosen. Successful teams with good alignment were found to be characterized by having established expectations, team trust, honesty within the team, shared values, and good communication. No notable differences were found among delivery methods, demonstrating that the principles of team alignment are not dependent on the project delivery method. Challenges that cause adversarial relationships in the team include issues of constructability, schedule availability, and project complexity. The study also identified transportation-specific alignment challenges such as public involvement. The greatest challenges specific to each delivery method include team coordination for construction manager at risk (CMAR) projects, constructability procedures for design-bid-build projects, and environmental impacts for design-build projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",6irFLAdLED/-456409

This paper compares over-design to redesign as approaches to address the emergence of future requirements. Net present value (NPV) analyses of several real world applications are examined from the perspective of manufacturers (i.e., defense contractors, automobile, pharmaceutical, and microprocessor manufactures) and customers (i.e., purchases of vehicles, televisions, cell phones, washing machines, and buildings). This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher NPV than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research, and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low. © 2019 by ASME.",Pn5nQbmcoP/-456409

Often, these models are large and complex, containing more parameters than can be identified from the available system measurements. We demonstrate our method on transient stability models, using the IEEE 14-bus test system. Our approach uses techniques of information geometry to remove unidentifiable parameters from the model. We examine the case of a networked system with 58 parameters using full observations throughout the network. We show that greater reduction can be achieved when only partial observations are available, Including reduction of the network itself. © 2019 IEEE.",aIPEXHFjLd/-456409

Nonlinear ultrasonic techniques are very sensitive to the early presence of damage, more so than linear techniques. Nonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NRUS) is used here to measure a nonlinear shift in the resonance frequency due to a cumulative amount of SCC. Steel rods are immersed in a heated magnesium chloride solution and removed after different exposure times. NRUS measurements are conducted using the fundamental longitudinal mode of vibration. Rods exposed longer generally have a larger resonance frequency shift and are therefore more nonlinear. Thus NRUS might offer a means of detecting a cumulative SCC damage in a sample. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",5l15wBS5qo/-456409

55c5e3a2-cd61-4eff-8e9d-a062df018c3c,Influence of micro-structured superhydrophobic surfaces on nucleation and natural convection in a heated pool- again but new,2022,"This work experimentally explores sub-boiling pool nucleation on micro-structured superhydrophobic surfaces. All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40–90 °C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",j5BPfzUJBc/-456409

In single-input, single-output (SISO) applications, pulse truncation and state-space partitioning reduce the computational complexity of the trellis detector with only modest bit error rate (BER) performance penalties. In this paper it is shown that layering pulse truncation and state-space partition complexity-reducing techniques with a burst-based orthogonal space-time block-code does not introduce additional BER performance losses relative to the SISO case. © 2019 IEEE.",OWQg4KHS2W/-456409

5e46003a-c926-4016-8d55-740915e4c29f,Changes in perceptions of ethical climate among undergraduate engineering students- again but new,2022,"Promoting ethical conduct and social responsibility among undergraduate engineering graduates has been an ongoing challenge for many universities around the world. Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

However, measurements of full-scale, high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms. The field regions compare favorably to some spatiospectral lobe features observed in measurements of an F-35B aircraft operating at afterburner, though do not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, this has the effect of reducing user autonomy by diminishing the role personal values and priorities play in the decision-making process. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative approach that emphasizes users' comprehension over compliance, with the goal of helping users to make more informed decisions regarding their own security. To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost. We also find that system trust is a major factor in users' interpretation of system determinations of risk, and that properly communicating risk requires an understanding of user perceptions of the larger security ecosystem in whole. © is held by the author/owner.",FmG28357e8/-456409

The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TÜBİTAK",a5Gd5TqFdy/-456409

Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths. The layer is also patternable to sizes as small as a few microns with high resolution. Conclusion: By combining a metal layer and a layer of nanoparticles in photoresist, a simple, cheap, and effective light-blocking antireflective layer can be created that is compatible with planar devices with complex topography. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",rZHY6RcGSZ/-456409
